# Knowledge Base

## Foundations & Databricks Lakehouse Platform

### Databricks Fundamentals

#### Introduction to Databricks

Databricks is a unified data analytics platform that combines data engineering, data science, and business analytics into a single, integrated environment. Founded by the creators of Apache Spark, Databricks provides an enterprise-grade, cloud-based platform that enables organizations to process and analyze massive datasets efficiently.

**Key Components of the Databricks Platform:**

The Databricks platform consists of several integrated components:

1. **Workspace** - The web-based interface where users interact with Databricks
2. **Notebooks** - Interactive documents for writing and executing code
3. **Clusters** - Compute resources that execute the code written in notebooks
4. **Jobs** - Scheduled or triggered execution of notebooks or other code
5. **Data** - Storage and management of datasets in various formats

#### Lakehouse Architecture Fundamentals

The data lakehouse architecture represents a modern approach to data management that combines the best features of data warehouses and data lakes.

**Data Lakehouse vs. Data Warehouse vs. Data Lake:**

| Feature | Data Lake | Data Warehouse | Data Lakehouse |
|---------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Data Structure | Unstructured/semi-structured | Highly structured | Supports all data types |
| Schema | Schema-on-read | Schema-on-write | Schema enforcement with flexibility |
| Data Quality | Limited | High | High |
| Performance | Variable | Optimized | Optimized |
| Cost | Lower storage costs | Higher costs | Balance of cost and performance |
| Use Cases | Data science, ML | BI reporting | Unified analytics |

**The Medallion Architecture:**

The medallion architecture is a data organization framework used in the lakehouse that organizes data into three tiers:

1. **Bronze (Raw)** - Contains raw data ingested from various sources with minimal processing
2. **Silver (Validated)** - Data that has been cleansed, conformed, and validated
3. **Gold (Enriched)** - Business-level aggregates and enriched data ready for consumption

**Benefits of the Lakehouse Approach:**

- Eliminates data silos and reduces data duplication
- Provides a single source of truth for all analytics workloads
- Enables both batch and streaming data processing
- Supports diverse workloads including BI, ML, and data science
- Offers ACID transactions through Delta Lake
- Reduces total cost of ownership through unified architecture

#### Databricks Clusters and Runtimes

Clusters are the computational resources that execute your code in Databricks.

**Types of Clusters:**

1. **All-Purpose Clusters** - Interactive clusters used for development, exploration, and ad-hoc analysis
2. **Jobs Clusters** - Created automatically when jobs are triggered and terminated upon completion

**Databricks Runtime (DBR):**

- The Databricks Runtime is a set of software components optimized to run on the Databricks platform
- Includes Apache Spark plus performance improvements and integrations with other systems
- Available in different versions with varying components and features
- Specialized runtime options include:
  - Standard Runtime (includes Spark)
  - Machine Learning Runtime (includes ML libraries)
  - Genomics Runtime (optimized for genomic data)
  - Light Runtime (minimal dependencies)

**Cluster Termination:**

- All-purpose clusters can be configured to automatically terminate after a period of inactivity
- Jobs clusters terminate automatically upon job completion
- Manual termination stops all running operations and releases compute resources
- Termination does not delete any data or notebooks

---

### Advanced Databricks Features

#### Version Control with Databricks Repos

Databricks Repos enables Git-based version control directly within the Databricks workspace.

**Key Features:**

- Direct integration with Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
- Support for standard Git operations:
  - Clone repositories
  - Create and switch branches
  - Commit changes
  - Pull latest changes
  - Resolve merge conflicts

**CI/CD Workflows with Repos:**

- Enable automated testing of notebooks
- Facilitate collaborative development
- Support deployment pipeline integration
- Maintain versioning history
- Implement proper change management processes

**Limitations Compared to Traditional Git:**

- Some complex Git operations might require using the Git CLI or external tools
- Large file handling differs from standard Git
- Merge conflict resolution has a different interface than traditional Git tools

#### Multi-Language Notebook Development

Databricks notebooks support multiple programming languages, allowing different cell types within the same notebook.

**Supported Languages:**

- Python (default)
- SQL
- Scala
- R

**Language Switching in Notebooks:**

- Use magic commands to switch between languages:
  - `%python` for Python code
  - `%sql` for SQL queries
  - `%scala` for Scala code
  - `%r` for R code

**Notebook Workflows:**

- Notebooks can call other notebooks using the `%run` command
- Example: `%run /path/to/notebook`
- Variables and functions defined in the called notebook become available in the calling notebook
- This enables modular development and code reuse

#### Hands-On Practice: Creating and Managing Databricks Resources

   data = [("Bronze", "Raw data"), 
           ("Silver", "Cleaned data"), 
           ("Gold", "Business-ready data")]
   
   medallic_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Layer", "Description"])
   display(medallic_df)
   ```

#### Exercise 3: Implementing a Simple Medallion Architecture

Let's create a new notebook to implement a basic medallion architecture:

1. Create a new notebook called "Medallion-Architecture-Demo"
2. Run the following cells in sequence:

##### Step 1: Generate Sample Data (Bronze Layer)

```python
# Generate sample sales data
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Create a sample dataset with some inconsistencies and issues
data = []
start_date = datetime(2023, 1, 1)

# Generate 100 sample records
for i in range(100):
    # Create some data quality issues randomly
    if random.random() < 0.1:
        # Some records have null values
        customer_id = None
    else:
        customer_id = f"CUST-{random.randint(1, 20):04d}"
    
    # Some dates are missing
    if random.random() < 0.05:
        date = None
    else:
        date = (start_date + timedelta(days=random.randint(0, 60))).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    
    # Some product IDs have different formats
    if random.random() < 0.15:
        product_id = f"prod-{random.randint(1, 50)}"
    else:
        product_id = f"PROD-{random.randint(1, 50):03d}"
    
    # Some quantities are invalid (negative)
    if random.random() < 0.08:
        quantity = -random.randint(1, 10)
    else:
        quantity = random.randint(1, 10)
    
    # Some prices have incorrect decimal places or are zero
    if random.random() < 0.07:
        price = round(random.random() * 100, random.randint(0, 4))
    else:
        price = round(random.random() * 100, 2)
    
    data.append((customer_id, date, product_id, quantity, price))

# Create a DataFrame
bronze_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["customer_id", "date", "product_id", "quantity", "price"])

# Save as a Delta table
bronze_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("bronze_sales")

# Display the bronze data
print("Bronze Layer Data (Raw):")
display(spark.table("bronze_sales"))
```

##### Step 2: Clean and Validate Data (Silver Layer)

```python
# Read from the bronze layer
bronze_data = spark.table("bronze_sales")

# Clean and validate the data
silver_data = (bronze_data
    # Filter out records with null customer_id or date
    .filter(F.col("customer_id").isNotNull() & F.col("date").isNotNull())
    
    # Standardize product_id format
    .withColumn("product_id", 
        F.when(F.col("product_id").startswith("prod-"), 
               F.concat(F.lit("PROD-"), F.lpad(F.regexp_extract(F.col("product_id"), "prod-(\d+)", 1), 3, "0")))
        .otherwise(F.col("product_id")))
    
    # Ensure quantity is positive
    .withColumn("quantity", 
        F.when(F.col("quantity") <= 0, None)
        .otherwise(F.col("quantity")))
    
    # Ensure price has exactly 2 decimal places and is positive
    .withColumn("price", 
        F.when(F.col("price") <= 0, None)
        .otherwise(F.round(F.col("price"), 2)))
    
    # Convert date string to date type
    .withColumn("date", F.to_date(F.col("date")))
    
    # Add a month column for aggregation in gold layer
    .withColumn("month", F.date_format(F.col("date"), "yyyy-MM"))
)

# Save as a Delta table
silver_data.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("silver_sales")

# Display the silver data
print("Silver Layer Data (Cleaned and Validated):")
display(spark.table("silver_sales"))
```

##### Step 3: Create Aggregated Business Views (Gold Layer)

```python
# Read from the silver layer
silver_data = spark.table("silver_sales")

# Create monthly sales summary by product
gold_monthly_product_sales = (silver_data
    .groupBy("month", "product_id")
    .agg(
        F.count("*").alias("transaction_count"),
        F.sum("quantity").alias("total_quantity"),
        F.sum(F.col("quantity") * F.col("price")).alias("total_sales_amount"),
        F.avg("price").alias("average_price")
    )
    .orderBy("month", "product_id")
)

# Save as a Delta table
gold_monthly_product_sales.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("gold_monthly_product_sales")

# Create customer spending summary
gold_customer_summary = (silver_data
    .groupBy("customer_id")
    .agg(
        F.countDistinct("date").alias("active_days"),
        F.count("*").alias("transaction_count"),
        F.sum(F.col("quantity") * F.col("price")).alias("total_spend"),
        F.max("date").alias("last_purchase_date")
    )
    .orderBy(F.col("total_spend").desc())
)

# Save as a Delta table
gold_customer_summary.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("gold_customer_summary")

# Display the gold layer tables
print("Gold Layer Data - Monthly Product Sales:")
display(spark.table("gold_monthly_product_sales"))

print("Gold Layer Data - Customer Summary:")
display(spark.table("gold_customer_summary"))
```

#### Exercise 4: Running Notebooks from Another Notebook

1. Create a new notebook called "Master-Notebook"
2. Use the %run command to execute our previous notebooks:

```python
# Run the Medallion Architecture notebook
%run /DE-Certification/Medallion-Architecture-Demo

# Now we can work with the tables created in that notebook
print("Accessing Gold Layer tables from the master notebook:")
display(spark.sql("SELECT * FROM gold_monthly_product_sales LIMIT 5"))
```

#### Exercise 5: Working with Databricks Repos (Version Control)

If your Databricks workspace has Repos enabled:

1. Click on "Repos" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Add Repo"
3. For this exercise, you can:
   - Clone a sample repository from GitHub (e.g., https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/media-data-lakehouse)
   - Or create a new repo connected to your GitHub (if you have an account)
4. Explore the repository structure
5. Make a small change to a file, commit it, and push (if connected to your personal repo)

## ELT with Apache Spark

### Data Extraction and Basic Transformations

#### Data Extraction Techniques

Apache Spark provides versatile capabilities for extracting data from various sources. The Databricks platform enhances these capabilities with optimized readers and connectors.

##### Extracting Data from Files

Spark supports multiple file formats, each with specific readers:

```python
# Reading CSV files
csv_df = spark.read.format("csv") \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .option("inferSchema", "true") \
    .load("/path/to/file.csv")

# Reading Parquet files
parquet_df = spark.read.parquet("/path/to/directory")

# Reading JSON files
json_df = spark.read.json("/path/to/file.json")

# Reading from a directory of files
directory_df = spark.read.format("csv") \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .option("inferSchema", "true") \
    .load("/path/to/directory/*.csv")
```

##### Extracting Data from JDBC Sources

Connecting to relational databases:

```python
jdbc_df = spark.read \
    .format("jdbc") \
    .option("url", "jdbc:postgresql://server:port/database") \
    .option("dbtable", "schema.table") \
    .option("user", "username") \
    .option("password", "password") \
    .load()
```

#### Temporary Tables, Views, and CTEs

Spark SQL offers different ways to reference datasets:

##### Temporary Views

```python
# Creating a temporary view
df.createOrReplaceTempView("temp_view_name")

# Using the temporary view
result = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM temp_view_name WHERE column > 10")
```

Temporary views exist only within the current Spark session.

##### Global Temporary Views

```python
# Creating a global temporary view
df.createOrReplaceGlobalTempView("global_view_name")

# Accessing the global temporary view
result = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM global_temp.global_view_name")
```

Global temporary views exist across all sessions within the same Spark application.

##### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs provide a way to write auxiliary statements for use in a larger query:

```sql
-- Using a CTE
WITH revenue_data AS (
  SELECT product_id, SUM(amount) as total_revenue
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY product_id
)
SELECT p.name, r.total_revenue
FROM products p
JOIN revenue_data r ON p.id = r.product_id
ORDER BY r.total_revenue DESC
```

#### Transformation Fundamentals with Spark SQL

Spark SQL provides a comprehensive set of functions for data manipulation:

##### Basic Transformations

```python
# Filtering data
filtered_df = df.filter(df.age > 25)
# SQL equivalent
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM people WHERE age > 25")

# Selecting columns
selected_df = df.select("name", "age", "department")
# SQL equivalent
spark.sql("SELECT name, age, department FROM people")

# Adding new columns
enhanced_df = df.withColumn("age_group", 
                          when(df.age < 18, "minor")
                         .when(df.age < 65, "adult")
                         .otherwise("senior"))
# SQL equivalent
spark.sql("""
  SELECT *, 
    CASE 
      WHEN age < 18 THEN 'minor'
      WHEN age < 65 THEN 'adult'
      ELSE 'senior'
    END as age_group
  FROM people
""")
```

##### Aggregations

```python
# Grouping and aggregating
agg_df = df.groupBy("department").agg(
    avg("salary").alias("avg_salary"),
    count("*").alias("employee_count"),
    sum("salary").alias("total_salary")
)

# SQL equivalent
spark.sql("""
  SELECT 
    department, 
    AVG(salary) as avg_salary,
    COUNT(*) as employee_count,
    SUM(salary) as total_salary
  FROM people
  GROUP BY department
""")
```

#### Working with DataFrames and Tables

##### Converting DataFrames to Delta Tables

```python
# Saving as a managed Delta table
df.write.format("delta").saveAsTable("database_name.table_name")

# Saving as an external Delta table
df.write.format("delta").option("path", "/path/to/data").saveAsTable("database_name.table_name")

# Overwriting data
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("database_name.table_name")

# Appending data
df.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable("database_name.table_name")
```

##### Reading from Delta Tables

```python
# Reading a Delta table
table_df = spark.read.table("database_name.table_name")

# Alternative syntax
table_df = spark.table("database_name.table_name")

# SQL equivalent
table_df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM database_name.table_name")
```

### Hands-on Exercise: Building an ETL Pipeline

Let's create a basic ETL pipeline that extracts data from a CSV file, transforms it, and loads it into a Delta table:

1. First, we'll create sample data:

```python
# Create a sample dataset
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# Generate sample customer data
data = [
    (1, "John Smith", "1980-05-15", "New York", 35000),
    (2, "Mary Johnson", "1992-07-22", "Los Angeles", 42000),
    (3, "James Brown", "1975-11-03", "Chicago", 55000),
    (4, "Patricia Davis", "1988-03-29", "Houston", 67000),
    (5, "Robert Miller", None, "Philadelphia", 48000),
    (6, "Linda Wilson", "1990-09-12", "Phoenix", None),
    (7, "Michael Moore", "1982-04-08", "San Antonio", 51000),
    (8, "Elizabeth Taylor", "1985-12-25", "San Diego", 44000),
    (9, "William Anderson", "1978-02-17", "Dallas", 39000),
    (10, "Jennifer Thomas", "1995-06-10", None, 61000)
]

# Create DataFrame and save as CSV
columns = ["customer_id", "name", "birthdate", "city", "annual_income"]
customer_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)
customer_df.write.mode("overwrite").csv("/tmp/customer_data", header=True)

print("Sample data created successfully")
```

2. Now, let's build an ETL pipeline:

```python
# EXTRACT: Read data from CSV
raw_df = spark.read.format("csv") \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .option("inferSchema", "true") \
    .load("/tmp/customer_data")

print("Extracted data:")
display(raw_df)

# TRANSFORM: Clean and enhance the data
transformed_df = raw_df \
    .withColumn("birthdate", F.to_date(F.col("birthdate"))) \
    .withColumn("age", F.floor(F.months_between(F.current_date(), F.col("birthdate")) / 12)) \
    .withColumn("city", F.when(F.col("city").isNull(), "Unknown").otherwise(F.col("city"))) \
    .withColumn("annual_income", F.when(F.col("annual_income").isNull(), 0).otherwise(F.col("annual_income"))) \
    .withColumn("income_bracket", 
               F.when(F.col("annual_income") < 40000, "Low")
                .when(F.col("annual_income") < 60000, "Medium")
                .otherwise("High"))

print("Transformed data:")
display(transformed_df)

# LOAD: Save as a Delta table
transformed_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("customer_data")

print("Data loaded into Delta table 'customer_data'")

# Verify the data
print("Data in Delta table:")
display(spark.table("customer_data"))
```

---

### Advanced Transformations

#### Data Deduplication Techniques

Duplicated data is a common issue in data engineering. Spark provides several methods for handling duplicates:

##### Identifying Duplicates

```python
# Count duplicates
duplicate_counts = df.groupBy("id").count().filter("count > 1")

# SQL equivalent
spark.sql("""
  SELECT id, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY id
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
""")
```

##### Removing Duplicates

```python
# Remove complete duplicates
deduplicated_df = df.distinct()

# SQL equivalent
spark.sql("SELECT DISTINCT * FROM table_name")

# Remove duplicates based on specific columns
deduplicated_df = df.dropDuplicates(["id", "transaction_date"])

# SQL equivalent
spark.sql("""
  WITH ranked_data AS (
    SELECT *,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id, transaction_date ORDER BY id) as rn
    FROM table_name
  )
  SELECT * FROM ranked_data WHERE rn = 1
""")
```

#### Data Validation Techniques

Validating data quality is crucial in ETL processes:

##### Primary Key Validation

```python
# Check if id column contains unique values
id_counts = df.groupBy("id").count()
duplicate_ids = id_counts.filter("count > 1")

if duplicate_ids.count() > 0:
    print("Primary key constraint violated")
    display(duplicate_ids)
else:
    print("Primary key constraint satisfied")
```

##### Foreign Key Validation

```python
# Check if all product_ids exist in the products table
product_ids_in_orders = orders_df.select("product_id").distinct()
valid_product_ids = products_df.select("id").distinct()

invalid_product_ids = product_ids_in_orders.join(
    valid_product_ids,
    product_ids_in_orders["product_id"] == valid_product_ids["id"],
    "left_anti"
)

if invalid_product_ids.count() > 0:
    print("Foreign key constraint violated")
    display(invalid_product_ids)
else:
    print("Foreign key constraint satisfied")
```

#### Working with Complex Data Types

##### Handling Timestamps

```python
# Converting string to timestamp
df = df.withColumn("event_time", F.to_timestamp(F.col("event_time_string")))

# Extracting components from timestamps
df = df.withColumn("year", F.year("event_time")) \
       .withColumn("month", F.month("event_time")) \
       .withColumn("day", F.dayofmonth("event_time")) \
       .withColumn("hour", F.hour("event_time"))

# Calculating date differences
df = df.withColumn("days_since_purchase", 
                  F.datediff(F.current_date(), F.col("purchase_date")))
```

##### Working with JSON and Nested Structures

```python
# Parsing JSON string into struct
df = df.withColumn("json_data", F.from_json(F.col("json_string"), schema))

# Accessing nested fields
df = df.withColumn("customer_name", F.col("json_data.customer.name"))

# Exploding arrays into multiple rows
df = df.withColumn("item", F.explode("items"))

# JSON schema definition example
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, ArrayType, IntegerType

schema = StructType([
    StructField("customer", StructType([
        StructField("name", StringType()),
        StructField("email", StringType())
    ])),
    StructField("items", ArrayType(StructType([
        StructField("item_id", StringType()),
        StructField("quantity", IntegerType())
    ])))
])
```

#### SQL User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

SQL UDFs allow for custom logic within SQL queries:

```sql
-- Creating a SQL UDF
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_tax(amount DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
RETURN amount * 0.07;

-- Using the UDF
SELECT item_name, price, calculate_tax(price) as tax_amount
FROM items;
```

#### Control Flow in Spark SQL

The CASE WHEN statement provides conditional logic in Spark SQL:

```sql
-- Using CASE WHEN for conditional logic
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  total_purchase,
  CASE 
    WHEN total_purchase < 100 THEN 'Low Value'
    WHEN total_purchase < 1000 THEN 'Medium Value'
    ELSE 'High Value'
  END as customer_segment
FROM customer_purchases;
```

### Hands-on Exercise: Advanced Transformations

Let's work with a more complex scenario involving nested data and deduplication:

```python
# Create sample order data with duplicates and nested structures
from pyspark.sql.types import *
import json

# Sample order data with JSON
order_data = [
    (1, "2023-01-15", '{"customer": {"id": 101, "name": "John Doe"}, "items": [{"id": "A1", "qty": 2}, {"id": "B3", "qty": 1}]}'),
    (2, "2023-01-16", '{"customer": {"id": 102, "name": "Jane Smith"}, "items": [{"id": "C2", "qty": 3}]}'),
    (1, "2023-01-15", '{"customer": {"id": 101, "name": "John Doe"}, "items": [{"id": "A1", "qty": 2}, {"id": "B3", "qty": 1}]}'),  # Duplicate
    (3, "2023-01-17", '{"customer": {"id": 103, "name": "Bob Johnson"}, "items": [{"id": "A1", "qty": 1}, {"id": "D4", "qty": 4}]}'),
    (4, "2023-01-18", '{"customer": {"id": 101, "name": "John Doe"}, "items": [{"id": "E5", "qty": 2}]}')
]

# Define the schema for the JSON data
json_schema = StructType([
    StructField("customer", StructType([
        StructField("id", IntegerType()),
        StructField("name", StringType())
    ])),
    StructField("items", ArrayType(StructType([
        StructField("id", StringType()),
        StructField("qty", IntegerType())
    ])))
])

# Create DataFrame
order_df = spark.createDataFrame(order_data, ["order_id", "order_date", "order_details"])

# Save as table
order_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("raw_orders")

print("Sample order data created:")
display(spark.table("raw_orders"))

# Now process the data with various transformations
processed_df = spark.table("raw_orders")

# 1. Remove duplicates
deduplicated_df = processed_df.dropDuplicates(["order_id", "order_date", "order_details"])
print(f"Removed {processed_df.count() - deduplicated_df.count()} duplicate orders")

# 2. Parse the JSON data
parsed_df = deduplicated_df.withColumn("order_details_parsed", 
                                    F.from_json(F.col("order_details"), json_schema))

# 3. Extract nested fields
extracted_df = parsed_df \
    .withColumn("customer_id", F.col("order_details_parsed.customer.id")) \
    .withColumn("customer_name", F.col("order_details_parsed.customer.name")) \
    .withColumn("items", F.col("order_details_parsed.items"))

# 4. Convert order_date to date type
date_df = extracted_df \
    .withColumn("order_date", F.to_date(F.col("order_date"))) \
    .withColumn("order_day", F.dayofweek(F.col("order_date"))) \
    .withColumn("order_month", F.month(F.col("order_date")))

print("After parsing JSON and extracting fields:")
display(date_df.select("order_id", "order_date", "customer_id", "customer_name", "items"))

# 5. Explode the items array into separate rows
exploded_df = date_df \
    .withColumn("item", F.explode("items")) \
    .withColumn("item_id", F.col("item.id")) \
    .withColumn("quantity", F.col("item.qty")) \
    .drop("items", "item", "order_details", "order_details_parsed")

print("After exploding items array:")
display(exploded_df)

# 6. Save the processed data
exploded_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("processed_orders")

print("Data saved to 'processed_orders' table")
```

Let's also demonstrate working with pivots and user-defined functions:

```python
# Create sample sales data
sales_data = [
    ("2023-01", "Electronics", 12500),
    ("2023-01", "Clothing", 8300),
    ("2023-01", "Home Goods", 5600),
    ("2023-02", "Electronics", 14200),
    ("2023-02", "Clothing", 9100),
    ("2023-02", "Home Goods", 6200),
    ("2023-03", "Electronics", 13800),
    ("2023-03", "Clothing", 8900),
    ("2023-03", "Home Goods", 7100)
]

sales_df = spark.createDataFrame(sales_data, ["month", "category", "revenue"])
sales_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("monthly_sales")

print("Monthly sales data:")
display(spark.table("monthly_sales"))

# Create a SQL UDF for calculating tax
spark.sql("""
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_tax(amount DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
RETURN amount * 0.08;
""")

# Use the UDF in a query
spark.sql("""
SELECT month, category, revenue, calculate_tax(revenue) AS tax
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY month, category
""").show()

# Create a pivot table
pivoted_sales = spark.sql("""
SELECT *
FROM monthly_sales
PIVOT (
    SUM(revenue) FOR category IN ('Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Home Goods')
)
ORDER BY month
""")

print("Pivoted sales data:")
display(pivoted_sales)
```

## Incremental Data Processing

### Delta Lake and ACID Transactions

#### Delta Lake Fundamentals

Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes. As a key technology in the Databricks Lakehouse platform, Delta Lake provides critical enterprise features for data management.

##### What is Delta Lake?

Delta Lake is a storage layer that sits on top of your existing data lake, providing:

- ACID transactions for reliable data operations
- Schema enforcement and evolution capabilities
- Time travel (data versioning)
- Audit history of all changes
- Unified batch and streaming data processing

##### Delta Lake Architecture

Delta Lake stores data as Parquet files but adds a transaction log that tracks all changes to the table. This architecture consists of:

1. **Data Files**: Parquet-formatted files containing the actual data
2. **Delta Log**: A transaction log (stored in the `_delta_log` directory) that records all operations performed on the table
3. **Checkpoint Files**: Periodic snapshots of the table state for faster access

When a Delta table is queried, the Delta Lake engine consults the transaction log to determine which data files to read, ensuring a consistent view of the data.

#### ACID Transactions in Delta Lake

ACID transactions are a set of properties that guarantee reliability in database operations:

- **Atomicity**: Operations either complete entirely or not at all
- **Consistency**: Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions produce the same results as if executed sequentially
- **Durability**: Committed transactions remain saved even during system failures

Delta Lake implements these properties through its transaction log mechanism:

```python
# Example of an atomic operation
# This entire operation either succeeds or fails as a unit
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/path/to/delta-table")
```

##### Benefits of ACID Transactions

1. **Data Consistency**: Ensures data is always in a valid state even during concurrent operations
2. **Failure Recovery**: Maintains data integrity even if operations fail midway
3. **Concurrency Control**: Allows multiple users to access and modify data simultaneously
4. **Reliable Streaming**: Enables exactly-once processing semantics for streaming data

#### Data and Metadata Management

##### Understanding Data vs. Metadata

- **Data**: The actual values stored in your tables (rows and columns)
- **Metadata**: Information about the data, including:
  - Schema definitions
  - Partitioning information
  - Table properties
  - File locations
  - Statistics for query optimization

In Databricks, metadata is stored in the metastore, which can be:
- The Hive metastore (traditional)
- Unity Catalog (enterprise grade with enhanced governance)

##### Managed vs. External Tables

Databricks supports two types of Delta tables:

1. **Managed Tables**:
   - Both data and metadata are managed by Databricks
   - When you drop a managed table, both the data and metadata are deleted
   - The data is stored in the default Databricks storage location

2. **External Tables**:
   - Databricks manages only the metadata
   - The data is stored in a location you specify
   - When you drop an external table, only the metadata is deleted; the data remains intact

```sql
-- Creating a managed table
CREATE TABLE managed_table (id INT, name STRING);

-- Creating an external table
CREATE TABLE external_table (id INT, name STRING)
LOCATION '/path/to/external/storage';
```

To identify if a table is managed or external:

```sql
-- Check if a table is managed or external
DESCRIBE EXTENDED table_name;
```

Look for the `Type` property (managed or external) and the `Location` property.

#### Hands-On Exercise: Delta Lake Operations

Let's build a practical exercise to explore Delta Lake fundamentals:

```python
# Create a sample dataset
data = [(1, "Product A", 10.5, "2023-01-01"),
        (2, "Product B", 20.75, "2023-01-02"),
        (3, "Product C", 15.0, "2023-01-03"),
        (4, "Product D", 8.25, "2023-01-04"),
        (5, "Product E", 12.99, "2023-01-05")]

columns = ["id", "product_name", "price", "created_date"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Save as a managed Delta table
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("products_managed")

# Save as an external Delta table
external_path = "/tmp/delta/products_external"
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").option("path", external_path).saveAsTable("products_external")

print("Created both managed and external Delta tables")

# Examine table information
print("\nManaged Table Information:")
display(spark.sql("DESCRIBE EXTENDED products_managed"))

print("\nExternal Table Information:")
display(spark.sql("DESCRIBE EXTENDED products_external"))

# Inspect Delta log structure
print("\nDelta Log Structure:")
display(dbutils.fs.ls(external_path + "/_delta_log"))

# Make modifications to track history
# Add a new product
new_product = [(6, "Product F", 22.5, "2023-01-06")]
new_df = spark.createDataFrame(new_product, columns)
new_df.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable("products_managed")

# Update a product price
spark.sql("UPDATE products_managed SET price = 11.99 WHERE id = 1")

# View table history
print("\nTable History:")
display(spark.sql("DESCRIBE HISTORY products_managed"))

# Time travel query
print("\nData as of Version 0:")
display(spark.sql("SELECT * FROM products_managed VERSION AS OF 0"))

print("\nCurrent data (latest version):")
display(spark.sql("SELECT * FROM products_managed"))
```
---

### Delta Lake Operations and Optimizations

#### Table History and Time Travel

Delta Lake's transaction log enables powerful versioning capabilities:

```sql
-- View the history of a Delta table
DESCRIBE HISTORY delta_table;

-- Query a specific version of a table
SELECT * FROM delta_table VERSION AS OF 3;

-- Query a table as of a specific timestamp
SELECT * FROM delta_table TIMESTAMP AS OF '2023-01-15T00:00:00.000Z';

-- Restore a table to a previous version
RESTORE TABLE delta_table TO VERSION AS OF 3;
```

#### Optimizing Delta Tables

Delta Lake provides several operations to optimize table performance:

##### Z-Ordering

Z-ordering is a technique that co-locates related data in the same files, improving query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be read:

```sql
-- Z-order by one or more columns
OPTIMIZE delta_table
ZORDER BY (date_column, region_column);
```

Benefits of Z-Ordering:
- Improves filtering and join performance
- Particularly useful for high-cardinality columns frequently used in query predicates
- Makes data skipping more effective

##### VACUUM and Data Retention

The `VACUUM` command permanently removes files no longer needed by the Delta table:

```sql
-- Remove files not needed for versions older than 7 days
VACUUM delta_table RETAIN 7 DAYS;
```

By default, Delta Lake retains 30 days of history. This can be configured through table properties:

```sql
-- Set retention period to 90 days
ALTER TABLE delta_table 
SET TBLPROPERTIES ('delta.logRetentionDuration' = '90 days');
```

##### OPTIMIZE for File Compaction

Small files can degrade query performance. The `OPTIMIZE` command compacts small files into larger ones:

```sql
-- Compact small files without reordering data
OPTIMIZE delta_table;
```

#### Advanced Table Features

##### Generated Columns

Generated columns are automatically calculated from other columns:

```sql
-- Create a table with a generated column
CREATE TABLE sales (
  id INT,
  amount DOUBLE,
  tax DOUBLE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (amount * 0.07)
);
```

##### Table Comments and Properties

Add documentation and configure behavior through comments and properties:

```sql
-- Add a comment to a table
COMMENT ON TABLE sales IS 'Daily sales transactions';

-- Add a comment to a column
COMMENT ON COLUMN sales.amount IS 'Sale amount in USD';

-- Set table properties
ALTER TABLE sales 
SET TBLPROPERTIES (
  'delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite' = 'true',
  'delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact' = 'true'
);
```
---

### Incremental Data Loading

#### Overwrite Operations

##### CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE

This operation replaces a table with a new definition:

```sql
-- Create or replace a table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customer_data
AS SELECT * FROM customer_source WHERE region = 'Europe';
```

##### INSERT OVERWRITE

This operation replaces existing data while preserving the table schema and properties:

```sql
-- Overwrite all data in the table
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE customer_data
SELECT * FROM customer_source WHERE region = 'North America';
```

Differences between these approaches:

- `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` recreates the entire table, potentially changing the schema
- `INSERT OVERWRITE` preserves the table structure and only replaces the data

#### MERGE Operations

The `MERGE` statement is a powerful tool for upserting data (insert, update, or delete in a single atomic operation):

```sql
-- Basic MERGE operation
MERGE INTO target_table
USING source_table
ON target_table.id = source_table.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET 
    target_table.column1 = source_table.column1,
    target_table.column2 = source_table.column2
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (id, column1, column2)
  VALUES (source_table.id, source_table.column1, source_table.column2);
```

Benefits of MERGE:
- Atomic updates (all-or-nothing)
- Efficient handling of inserts and updates in a single operation
- Support for conditional logic
- Eliminates the need for staging tables

#### COPY INTO

The `COPY INTO` command is a simple, idempotent way to load data incrementally:

```sql
-- Load data incrementally from a directory
COPY INTO target_table
FROM '/path/to/source/files'
FILEFORMAT = CSV
FORMAT_OPTIONS ('header' = 'true', 'inferSchema' = 'true')
COPY_OPTIONS ('mergeSchema' = 'true');
```

Key features:
- Loads only new files not previously ingested
- Tracks loaded files to avoid duplication
- Simpler than MERGE for basic ingestion patterns
- Supports various file formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.)

#### Delta Live Tables (DLT)

Delta Live Tables provides a declarative framework for building reliable data pipelines:

##### Components of a DLT Pipeline

1. **Target**: The database where tables will be created
2. **Notebook Libraries**: Notebooks containing the transformation logic
3. **Configuration**: Settings for the pipeline execution

##### Pipeline Types

- **Triggered Pipelines**: Run on demand or on a schedule
- **Continuous Pipelines**: Process data as it arrives (near real-time)

##### Auto Loader

Auto Loader simplifies streaming ingestion from file sources:

```python
# Using Auto Loader in Python
spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles")
  .option("cloudFiles.format", "json")
  .option("cloudFiles.schemaLocation", "/path/to/schema")
  .load("/path/to/source/files")
```

Features:
- Efficiently processes new files as they arrive
- Handles schema inference and evolution
- Scales to millions of files without listing directories

##### Data Quality Constraints

DLT supports data quality validation through constraints:

```python
# Table with constraints
@dlt.table(
  comment="Validated customer data",
  table_properties={"quality": "silver"}
)
@dlt.expect_or_drop("valid_id", "id IS NOT NULL")
@dlt.expect_or_fail("valid_email", "email LIKE '%@%.%'")
def validated_customers():
  return spark.table("raw_customers").filter("age > 0")
```

Constraint handling options:
- `@dlt.expect_or_drop`: Drop records that violate the constraint
- `@dlt.expect_or_fail`: Fail the pipeline if any record violates the constraint
- `@dlt.expect`: Track violations without affecting the pipeline

##### Change Data Capture (CDC)

CDC processes data changes from source systems:

```python
# Apply CDC changes
@dlt.table
def customers_target():
  return (
    dlt.apply_changes(
      target = "customers_target",
      source = "customers_raw_stream",
      keys = ["customer_id"],
      sequence_by = "operation_timestamp",
      ignore_null_updates = False,
      apply_as_deletes = "operation = 'DELETE'"
    )
  )
```

Benefits:
- Efficiently processes change data from databases
- Supports insert, update, and delete operations
- Maintains a consistent target state

#### Hands-On Exercise: Incremental Data Processing

Let's implement a comprehensive incremental processing example:

```python
# Set up sample data
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Create initial customer data
base_customers = [
    (1, "John Doe", "john@example.com", "New York"),
    (2, "Jane Smith", "jane@example.com", "Los Angeles"),
    (3, "Mike Johnson", "mike@example.com", "Chicago"),
    (4, "Lisa Brown", "lisa@example.com", "Houston"),
    (5, "David Wilson", "david@example.com", "Phoenix")
]

# Save as initial table
customers_df = spark.createDataFrame(base_customers, ["id", "name", "email", "city"])
customers_df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("customers")

print("Initial customer data created:")
display(spark.table("customers"))

# Create updates (some new, some modified records)
customer_updates = [
    (3, "Michael Johnson", "michael@example.com", "Chicago"),  # Modified
    (4, "Lisa Brown", "lisa@example.com", "Dallas"),  # Modified
    (6, "Sarah Lee", "sarah@example.com", "Miami"),  # New
    (7, "Robert Chen", "robert@example.com", "Seattle")  # New
]

updates_df = spark.createDataFrame(customer_updates, ["id", "name", "email", "city"])
updates_df.createOrReplaceTempView("customer_updates")

print("Customer updates:")
display(updates_df)

# Approach 1: Using MERGE
spark.sql("""
MERGE INTO customers target
USING customer_updates source
ON target.id = source.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET 
    target.name = source.name,
    target.email = source.email,
    target.city = source.city
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (id, name, email, city)
  VALUES (source.id, source.name, source.email, source.city)
""")

print("After MERGE operation:")
display(spark.table("customers"))

# Approach 2: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE with partitioning
# Create a new dataset with dates for partitioning
customers_with_dates = []
start_date = datetime(2023, 1, 1)

for i in range(1, 8):
    if i <= 5:
        date = (start_date + timedelta(days=i)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        customers_with_dates.append((i, f"Customer {i}", f"customer{i}@example.com", f"City {i}", date))

# Create partitioned table
partitioned_df = spark.createDataFrame(
    customers_with_dates, 
    ["id", "name", "email", "city", "registration_date"]
)

# Save as partitioned table
partitioned_df.write.format("delta") \
    .partitionBy("registration_date") \
    .mode("overwrite") \
    .saveAsTable("customers_partitioned")

print("Partitioned customer table:")
display(spark.table("customers_partitioned"))

# Show partitions
print("Table partitions:")
display(spark.sql("SHOW PARTITIONS customers_partitioned"))

# Create updates for specific partition
partition_updates = [
    (3, "Customer 3 Updated", "customer3new@example.com", "New City 3", "2023-01-03"),
    (8, "Customer 8 New", "customer8@example.com", "City 8", "2023-01-03")
]

partition_updates_df = spark.createDataFrame(
    partition_updates,
    ["id", "name", "email", "city", "registration_date"]
)

# Overwrite specific partition
spark.sql("""
INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE customers_partitioned
PARTITION (registration_date = '2023-01-03')
SELECT id, name, email, city, registration_date
FROM partition_updates_df
""")

print("After partition overwrite:")
display(spark.table("customers_partitioned"))

# Approach 3: COPY INTO for idempotent loads
# Create files to be loaded
incremental_data = [
    (9, "New Customer 9", "customer9@example.com", "Seattle"),
    (10, "New Customer 10", "customer10@example.com", "Portland")
]

incremental_df = spark.createDataFrame(incremental_data, ["id", "name", "email", "city"])
incremental_df.write.format("csv").option("header", "true").mode("overwrite").save("/tmp/incremental_loads/batch1")

# Second batch with some overlap
incremental_data2 = [
    (10, "New Customer 10", "customer10@example.com", "Portland"),  # Duplicate
    (11, "New Customer 11", "customer11@example.com", "Boston")
]

incremental_df2 = spark.createDataFrame(incremental_data2, ["id", "name", "email", "city"])
incremental_df2.write.format("csv").option("header", "true").mode("overwrite").save("/tmp/incremental_loads/batch2")

# Create target table
spark.sql("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS copy_into_target (id INT, name STRING, email STRING, city STRING)")

# Load data using COPY INTO
spark.sql("""
COPY INTO copy_into_target
FROM '/tmp/incremental_loads'
FILEFORMAT = CSV
FORMAT_OPTIONS ('header' = 'true', 'inferSchema' = 'true')
PATTERN = '*/batch*'
""")

print("After COPY INTO operation:")
display(spark.table("copy_into_target"))

# Run second time to demonstrate idempotency
spark.sql("""
COPY INTO copy_into_target
FROM '/tmp/incremental_loads'
FILEFORMAT = CSV
FORMAT_OPTIONS ('header' = 'true', 'inferSchema' = 'true')
PATTERN = '*/batch*'
""")

print("After second COPY INTO operation (should be idempotent):")
display(spark.table("copy_into_target"))
```

## Production Pipelines & Data Governance

### Production Pipelines

#### Introduction to Databricks Jobs

Databricks Jobs provide a way to orchestrate and schedule your data processing workflows in a production environment. They allow you to automate notebook execution, specify dependencies between tasks, and set up monitoring and alerting.

##### Key Concepts of Databricks Jobs

Jobs in Databricks consist of several components:

1. **Jobs**: The top-level container for workloads.
2. **Tasks**: Individual units of work within a job (e.g., a notebook, JAR file, or Python script).
3. **Runs**: Specific executions of jobs, including all task runs.
4. **Task Runs**: Individual executions of tasks within a job run.

##### Benefits of Using Jobs

- **Automation**: Schedule workloads to run on a specific cadence.
- **Orchestration**: Define complex workflows with dependencies between tasks.
- **Resource Isolation**: Jobs run on dedicated job clusters that terminate after completion.
- **Monitoring**: Track job progress, execution time, and failures.
- **Notifications**: Set up alerts for job failures or completion.
- **Cost Optimization**: Jobs clusters automatically terminate after completion.

#### Multi-Task Workflows

Modern data pipelines often consist of multiple interconnected steps that need to be executed in a specific order. Databricks Jobs support this through multi-task workflows.

##### Creating Task Dependencies

```python
# Pseudocode representation of a multi-task workflow
job = {
    "name": "Sales Processing Pipeline",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "task_key": "extract_data",
            "notebook_task": {
                "notebook_path": "/path/to/extract_notebook"
            },
            "job_cluster_key": "job_cluster"
        },
        {
            "task_key": "transform_data",
            "notebook_task": {
                "notebook_path": "/path/to/transform_notebook"
            },
            "job_cluster_key": "job_cluster",
            "depends_on": [
                {"task_key": "extract_data"}
            ]
        },
        {
            "task_key": "load_data",
            "notebook_task": {
                "notebook_path": "/path/to/load_notebook"
            },
            "job_cluster_key": "job_cluster",
            "depends_on": [
                {"task_key": "transform_data"}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The `depends_on` property specifies that a task should only run after its dependencies have completed successfully.

##### Task Execution Flow

When a multi-task job runs:

1. Tasks with no dependencies start immediately.
2. Tasks with dependencies wait until all dependencies complete successfully.
3. If a task fails, its dependent tasks will not run.
4. The job completes when all tasks either succeed or fail.

#### Job Scheduling with CRON

Databricks jobs can be scheduled to run automatically using CRON expressions.

##### CRON Expression Format

A CRON expression consists of 5-6 fields that define when a job should run:

```
â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ minute (0 - 59)
â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ hour (0 - 23)
â”‚ â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ day of month (1 - 31)
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€ month (1 - 12)
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€ day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday = 0)
â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚
* * * * *
```

Common CRON patterns:

- `0 0 * * *` - Run at midnight every day
- `0 */6 * * *` - Run every 6 hours
- `0 8 * * 1-5` - Run at 8 AM on weekdays
- `0 0 1 * *` - Run at midnight on the first day of each month

##### Setting Up a Schedule

When creating a job, you can specify a schedule using either a CRON expression or a simpler UI-based approach that generates the CRON expression for you.

#### Job Monitoring and Alerting

Monitoring job execution and setting up alerts for failures are crucial for maintaining reliable data pipelines.

##### Monitoring Job Execution

Databricks provides several ways to monitor jobs:

1. **Jobs UI**: View all jobs, their status, and execution history.
2. **Run Details**: Examine logs, task outputs, and execution time for a specific run.
3. **Metrics**: Track execution time, success rates, and resource utilization.

##### Setting Up Alerts

Databricks supports various notification mechanisms:

1. **Email Notifications**: Send emails on job failure or completion.
2. **Webhook Notifications**: Integrate with external systems like Slack or PagerDuty.
3. **REST API**: Programmatically check job status and take action.

##### Retry Policies

For transient failures, you can set up retry policies:

```json
{
  "task_key": "extract_data",
  "notebook_task": {
    "notebook_path": "/path/to/extract_notebook"
  },
  "retry_on_failure": {
    "max_retries": 3,
    "min_duration_between_retries_seconds": 60
  }
}
```

This configuration will retry the task up to 3 times with a 60-second delay between retries if it fails.

### Hands-on Exercise: Creating a Production Pipeline

Let's build a complete production pipeline that performs the following steps:
1. Extracts and processes daily sales data
2. Computes key metrics
3. Updates a reporting dashboard
4. Sends an email notification upon completion

For this exercise, we'll create three notebooks and link them in a job:

#### Notebook 1: Extract and Process Sales Data

```python
# Notebook: extract_sales_data
# This notebook extracts daily sales data and performs initial processing

# Log the start of the process
import datetime
current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
print(f"Starting sales data extraction at {current_time}")

# Create sample sales data (in a real scenario, you would extract from a source)
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Generate sales data for yesterday
yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
products = ["Product A", "Product B", "Product C", "Product D", "Product E"]
regions = ["North", "South", "East", "West", "Central"]

# Generate 100 random sales records
data = []
for i in range(100):
    product = random.choice(products)
    region = random.choice(regions)
    quantity = random.randint(1, 10)
    unit_price = round(random.uniform(10, 100), 2)
    total = round(quantity * unit_price, 2)
    
    data.append((yesterday, product, region, quantity, unit_price, total))

# Create DataFrame
columns = ["date", "product", "region", "quantity", "unit_price", "total_amount"]
sales_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Save as a Delta table, partitioned by date
sales_df.write.format("delta").partitionBy("date").mode("append").saveAsTable("daily_sales")

# Verify the data was written
count = spark.table("daily_sales").filter(F.col("date") == yesterday).count()
print(f"Successfully extracted {count} sales records for {yesterday}")

# Set a notebook parameter to pass to downstream tasks
dbutils.jobs.taskValues.set(key = "sales_date", value = yesterday)
dbutils.jobs.taskValues.set(key = "record_count", value = count)

print("Data extraction complete")
```

#### Notebook 2: Compute Sales Metrics

```python
# Notebook: compute_sales_metrics
# This notebook computes key sales metrics based on the extracted data

# Get the sales date from the upstream task
sales_date = dbutils.jobs.taskValues.get(taskKey = "extract_sales_data", key = "sales_date")
record_count = dbutils.jobs.taskValues.get(taskKey = "extract_sales_data", key = "record_count")

print(f"Computing sales metrics for {sales_date} with {record_count} records")

# Read the daily sales data
daily_sales = spark.table("daily_sales").filter(f"date = '{sales_date}'")

# Compute product-level metrics
product_metrics = daily_sales.groupBy("product").agg(
    F.sum("quantity").alias("total_quantity"),
    F.sum("total_amount").alias("total_revenue"),
    F.avg("unit_price").alias("average_price")
).orderBy(F.col("total_revenue").desc())

# Save product metrics
product_metrics.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").option("overwriteSchema", "true").saveAsTable("product_metrics_daily")

# Compute region-level metrics
region_metrics = daily_sales.groupBy("region").agg(
    F.countDistinct("product").alias("product_count"),
    F.sum("quantity").alias("total_quantity"),
    F.sum("total_amount").alias("total_revenue")
).orderBy(F.col("total_revenue").desc())

# Save region metrics
region_metrics.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").option("overwriteSchema", "true").saveAsTable("region_metrics_daily")

# Compute overall metrics for dashboard
overall_metrics = {
    "date": sales_date,
    "total_sales": daily_sales.select(F.sum("total_amount")).first()[0],
    "total_units": daily_sales.select(F.sum("quantity")).first()[0],
    "avg_order_value": daily_sales.select(F.avg("total_amount")).first()[0],
    "top_product": product_metrics.first()["product"],
    "top_region": region_metrics.first()["region"]
}

# Convert to DataFrame and save
metrics_df = spark.createDataFrame([overall_metrics])
metrics_df.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable("sales_overall_metrics")

# Pass metrics to the next task
dbutils.jobs.taskValues.set(key = "total_sales", value = overall_metrics["total_sales"])
dbutils.jobs.taskValues.set(key = "top_product", value = overall_metrics["top_product"])
dbutils.jobs.taskValues.set(key = "top_region", value = overall_metrics["top_region"])

print("Metrics computation complete")
```

#### Notebook 3: Update Dashboard and Notify

```python
# Notebook: update_dashboard
# This notebook updates a dashboard and sends a notification

# Get values from upstream tasks
sales_date = dbutils.jobs.taskValues.get(taskKey = "extract_sales_data", key = "sales_date")
total_sales = dbutils.jobs.taskValues.get(taskKey = "compute_sales_metrics", key = "total_sales")
top_product = dbutils.jobs.taskValues.get(taskKey = "compute_sales_metrics", key = "top_product")
top_region = dbutils.jobs.taskValues.get(taskKey = "compute_sales_metrics", key = "top_region")

print(f"Updating dashboard for {sales_date}")
print(f"Total sales: ${total_sales:.2f}")
print(f"Top product: {top_product}")
print(f"Top region: {top_region}")

# In a real scenario, you would use the Databricks API to refresh a dashboard
# or update an external BI tool

# Create a summary for notification
summary = f"""
Sales Report for {sales_date}
---------------------------
Total Sales: ${float(total_sales):.2f}
Top Product: {top_product}
Top Region: {top_region}

The complete report is available in the Databricks dashboard.
"""

# In a real scenario, you would send an email notification
# For this exercise, we'll just print the notification
print("Notification would be sent with the following content:")
print(summary)

print("Dashboard update and notification complete")
```

#### Creating a Multi-Task Job

To set up this workflow as a job:

1. Navigate to the Workflows section in Databricks
2. Click "Create Job"
3. Set up the first task:
   - Task name: extract_sales_data
   - Type: Notebook
   - Path: /path/to/extract_sales_data
   - Cluster: New job cluster (select appropriate configuration)
4. Add the second task:
   - Task name: compute_sales_metrics
   - Type: Notebook
   - Path: /path/to/compute_sales_metrics
   - Cluster: Same as task 1
   - Dependencies: extract_sales_data
5. Add the third task:
   - Task name: update_dashboard
   - Type: Notebook
   - Path: /path/to/update_dashboard
   - Cluster: Same as task 1
   - Dependencies: compute_sales_metrics
6. Set up a schedule:
   - Frequency: Daily
   - Start time: 01:00 AM
7. Configure notifications:
   - On failure: Email to team members
8. Save the job

This creates a complete ETL pipeline that runs daily, processes sales data, and updates dashboards with the results.

### Data Governance

#### Introduction to Data Governance

Data governance encompasses the policies, procedures, and standards that ensure data is managed as a valuable organizational asset. It focuses on data availability, usability, integrity, and security.

##### Four Areas of Data Governance

1. **Data Discovery**: Finding and understanding available data assets
2. **Access Control**: Managing who can access what data
3. **Audit and Compliance**: Tracking data usage and ensuring regulatory compliance
4. **Data Quality**: Ensuring data accuracy, completeness, and reliability

#### Unity Catalog Architecture

Unity Catalog is Databricks' solution for unified data governance across clouds and regions. It provides a centralized way to manage access to data, ML models, and analytics objects.

##### Metastores vs. Catalogs

**Metastore**:
- The top-level container in Unity Catalog
- Typically, one metastore per organization
- Contains catalogs, schemas (databases), and securable objects
- Linked to one or more Databricks workspaces

**Catalog**:
- A collection of schemas (databases)
- Used to organize data by business unit or project
- Examples: marketing_catalog, finance_catalog, hr_catalog

##### Three-Level Namespace

Unity Catalog uses a three-level namespace to address objects:
```
catalog.schema.object
```

For example:
```sql
-- Querying a table using the three-level namespace
SELECT * FROM marketing.customer_data.transactions;
```

Where:
- `marketing` is the catalog
- `customer_data` is the schema (database)
- `transactions` is the table

#### Security Models and Access Control

Unity Catalog implements fine-grained access control to data and analytical assets.

##### Securables in Unity Catalog

Securables are objects to which permissions can be granted:

1. **Metastore**: The top-level container
2. **Catalog**: Collection of schemas
3. **Schema**: Collection of tables and views
4. **Table/View**: Data objects
5. **Function**: User-defined functions
6. **Volume**: Locations for files
7. **Model**: Machine learning models

##### Access Control Principles

Unity Catalog follows these principles:

1. **Inheritance**: Permissions flow from higher-level objects to lower-level ones
2. **Least Privilege**: Users get only the permissions they need
3. **Separation of Duties**: Different roles handle different responsibilities

##### Common Permissions

```sql
-- Grant permission to read data
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE catalog.schema.table TO user@example.com;

-- Grant permission to modify data
GRANT MODIFY ON TABLE catalog.schema.table TO group sales_analysts;

-- Grant permission to manage a schema
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA catalog.schema TO group data_engineers;

-- Grant permission to access all tables in a schema
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA catalog.schema TO group analysts;
```

#### Service Principals

A service principal is an identity used by automated processes, applications, or services, rather than people.

##### Benefits of Service Principals

- No password expiration or rotation issues
- Clear separation between human and non-human access
- Easier to audit automated processes
- Can be restricted to specific operations

##### Creating and Using Service Principals

Service principals are created in the Databricks account console and can be assigned permissions like human users:

```sql
-- Grant a service principal access to a table
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE catalog.schema.table TO `service-principal://etl-process`;

-- Use service principal for a connection
CREATE CONNECTION my_connection
TYPE MYSQL
PROPERTIES (
  host = 'myhost.example.com',
  port = '3306',

#### Cluster Security Modes

Unity Catalog works with specific cluster security modes:

1. **Unity Catalog-enabled Clusters**: 
   - Support the three-level namespace
   - Enforce access controls defined in Unity Catalog
   - Required for accessing data governed by Unity Catalog

2. **User Isolation Mode**:
   - Each user's code runs as their own user identity
   - Users cannot access each other's data or resources
   - Increased security for multi-tenant use cases

#### Best Practices for Data Governance

1. **Colocate Metastores with Workspaces**:
   - Assign each workspace to a specific metastore
   - Reduces network latency and improves performance

2. **Use Service Principals for Connections**:
   - Avoid hardcoding credentials in notebooks
   - Better security and auditability

3. **Segregate Business Units Across Catalogs**:
   - Create separate catalogs for different departments
   - Simplifies access control and improves organization

4. **Implement Row-Level Security When Needed**:
   - For highly sensitive data that requires filtering based on user
   - Can be implemented using dynamic views

### Hands-on Exercise: Implementing Data Governance

Let's implement a comprehensive data governance structure for a fictional organization:

```python
# This is a demonstration of Unity Catalog concepts
# Note: Some commands require appropriate permissions to execute

# 1. Create a catalog structure for different departments
spark.sql("CREATE CATALOG IF NOT EXISTS marketing")
spark.sql("CREATE CATALOG IF NOT EXISTS finance")
spark.sql("CREATE CATALOG IF NOT EXISTS hr")

# 2. Create schemas within each catalog
spark.sql("CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS marketing.customer_data")
spark.sql("CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS marketing.campaign_analytics")
spark.sql("CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS finance.transactions")
spark.sql("CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS finance.reporting")
spark.sql("CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS hr.employee_records")

# 3. Create sample tables with different security requirements
# Marketing customer data
spark.sql("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS marketing.customer_data.profiles (
  customer_id INT,
  name STRING,
  email STRING,
  signup_date DATE,
  last_purchase_date DATE,
  total_spend DOUBLE
)
COMMENT 'Customer profile information'
""")

# Finance transaction data (sensitive)
spark.sql("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS finance.transactions.orders (
  order_id INT,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  amount DOUBLE,
  payment_method STRING,
  status STRING
)
COMMENT 'Financial transaction records - Sensitive data'
""")

# HR employee data (highly sensitive)
spark.sql("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hr.employee_records.employees (
  employee_id INT,
  name STRING,
  hire_date DATE,
  department STRING,
  salary DOUBLE,
  manager_id INT
)
COMMENT 'Employee records - Highly sensitive data'
""")

# 4. Insert some sample data
spark.sql("""
INSERT INTO marketing.customer_data.profiles VALUES
  (1, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com', '2022-01-15', '2023-02-20', 1250.50),

  (1003, 'Lisa Brown', '2019-11-20', 'HR', 78000.00, 1007)
""")

# 5. Create user groups (in real scenario, these would be created in account console)
# For demonstration purposes only
print("In a real deployment, you would create these groups in the account console:")
print("- marketing_team")
print("- finance_team")
print("- hr_team")
print("- data_analysts")
print("- data_engineers")
print("- executives")

# 6. Set up access control permissions
# Marketing team access

""")

# 7. Create a service principal for automated ETL processes
print("""

# Query finance data
display(spark.sql("SELECT * FROM finance.transactions.orders"))

# Query HR data
display(spark.sql("SELECT * FROM hr.employee_records.employees"))

# 9. Create a row-level security policy on sensitive data
# This is a simplified example of how you might implement RLS
print("""
-- Create a view with row-level security for salary data
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW hr.employee_records.employee_details AS
SELECT
  employee_id,
  name,
  hire_date,
  department,
  -- Only show salary to HR team and the employee's manager
  CASE 
    WHEN is_member('hr_team') OR current_user() IN (
      SELECT DISTINCT manager_email 
      FROM hr.employee_records.manager_directory 
      WHERE employee_id = e.employee_id
    )
    THEN salary
    ELSE NULL
  END as salary,
  manager_id
FROM hr.employee_records.employees e
""")

##  Review and Exam Preparation

### Comprehensive Topic Review

#### Databricks Lakehouse Platform

**Key Concepts:**

The Databricks Lakehouse Platform combines the best features of data warehouses and data lakes, providing a unified platform for all data workloads.

**Lakehouse Architecture:**
- Combines data lake storage flexibility with data warehouse reliability and performance
- Supports both structured and unstructured data
- Enables batch and streaming analytics in a single platform
- Implements ACID transactions through Delta Lake

**Medallion Architecture:**
- Bronze layer: Raw data ingested with minimal processing
- Silver layer: Cleansed, conformed, and validated data
- Gold layer: Business-level aggregates ready for consumption

**Databricks Environment Components:**
- Workspace: Web-based interface for collaboration
- Notebooks: Interactive documents for code development
- Clusters: Compute resources that execute code
- Jobs: Scheduled or triggered notebook executions
- Databricks Runtime (DBR): Software environment with Apache Spark and optimizations

**Databricks Repos and Version Control:**
- Git integration within Databricks
- Support for common Git operations (clone, commit, push/pull)
- Enables CI/CD workflows and collaborative development

#### ELT with Apache Spark

**Data Extraction:**
- Reading from various file formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
- Reading from databases using JDBC
- Extracting from directories of files

**Data References:**
- Temporary views: `df.createOrReplaceTempView("view_name")`
- Global temporary views: `df.createOrReplaceGlobalTempView("name")`
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs): `WITH` clause in SQL

**Data Transformation Techniques:**
- Filtering: `df.filter()` or `WHERE` clause in SQL
- Selection: `df.select()` or `SELECT` in SQL
- Column creation: `df.withColumn()` or expressions in SQL
- Aggregations: `df.groupBy().agg()` or `GROUP BY` in SQL

**Data Deduplication:**
- Complete duplicates: `df.distinct()` or `SELECT DISTINCT` in SQL
- Based on specific columns: `df.dropDuplicates(["col1", "col2"])`
- Using window functions: `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY`

**Complex Data Types:**
- Working with timestamps and dates: `to_timestamp()`, `date_format()`
- JSON parsing: `from_json()`, dot notation for accessing nested fields
- Array operations: `explode()`, `array_contains()`, `flatten()`

**SQL User-Defined Functions:**
- Creating UDFs: `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name(param_type) RETURNS return_type RETURN expression`
- Using UDFs in queries: `SELECT function_name(column) FROM table`

**Control Flow:**
- Using `CASE WHEN` statements for conditional logic
- Using custom control flow with UDFs

#### Incremental Data Processing

**Delta Lake Fundamentals:**
- ACID transaction support for data reliability
- Schema enforcement and evolution
- Time travel capabilities for data versioning
- Audit history of all operations

**Table Management:**
- Managed tables: Databricks manages both data and metadata
- External tables: Databricks manages only metadata, data is stored in a specified location

**Delta Operations:**
- Table history: `DESCRIBE HISTORY table_name`
- Time travel: `SELECT * FROM table_name VERSION AS OF version_number`
- Optimization: `OPTIMIZE table ZORDER BY (column_name)`
- File management: `VACUUM table_name RETAIN num_hours HOURS`

**Incremental Data Loading Patterns:**
- Complete overwrite: `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` or `INSERT OVERWRITE`
- Merge operations: `MERGE INTO target USING source ON condition`
- Idempotent loads: `COPY INTO target FROM source`

**Delta Live Tables (DLT):**
- Declarative data pipelines: Define what rather than how
- Pipeline types: Triggered vs. continuous
- Auto Loader: Efficient incremental file processing
- Data quality enforcement: Constraints and expectations
- Change data capture: `APPLY CHANGES INTO`

#### Production Pipelines & Data Governance

**Databricks Jobs:**
- Multi-task workflows with dependencies
- Scheduling with CRON expressions
- Monitoring and alerting mechanisms
- Retry policies for failure handling

**Data Governance with Unity Catalog:**
- Three-level namespace: catalog.schema.object
- Metastores vs. catalogs hierarchy
- Access control and permissions
- Service principals for automated processes
- Cluster security modes

**Best Practices:**
- Organizing data by business unit
- Using service principals for connections
- Implementing appropriate security controls
- Following the principle of least privilege

---

### Common Exam Pitfalls and Misconceptions

1. **Confusion between Managed and External Tables:**
   - Remember that dropping a managed table deletes both data and metadata
   - Dropping an external table deletes only the metadata, not the data

2. **Delta Lake Operations:**
   - `VACUUM` permanently removes files, not just marks them for deletion
   - `OPTIMIZE` compacts small files but doesn't affect data organization without `ZORDER BY`
   - Time travel queries are read-only; use `RESTORE` to revert a table

3. **Incremental Loading Patterns:**
   - `MERGE` is for upserts (update + insert)
   - `COPY INTO` is for idempotent new file ingestion
   - `INSERT OVERWRITE` preserves schema but replaces all data

4. **Unity Catalog Concepts:**
   - The correct namespace order is catalog.schema.object
   - Permissions inherit from parent objects to child objects
   - Service principals are for automated processes, not interactive usage

5. **Production Pipeline Design:**
   - Tasks with failed dependencies don't run
   - CRON expressions use the format: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week
   - Parameters can be passed between tasks using the `dbutils.jobs.taskValues` API

#### Review of First Mock Exam and Explanations

Now let's review the answers to the first mock exam and provide explanations for each question:

##### Section 1: Databricks Lakehouse Platform

1. **B) Data lakehouses provide ACID transactions, while data lakes typically don't**
   - Data lakehouses bring ACID transaction support to data lakes, which traditionally lack this capability. This is a fundamental difference between the two architectures.

2. **B) Silver**
   - In the medallion architecture, the Silver layer contains data that has been cleansed, conformed, and validated. Bronze contains raw data, and Gold contains business-level aggregates.

3. **B) Jobs clusters terminate automatically after job completion, while all-purpose clusters persist until manually terminated**
   - Jobs clusters are ephemeral and automatically terminate after completing their assigned job, making them cost-effective for scheduled workloads. All-purpose clusters remain running until manually terminated or until they reach their auto-termination period.

4. **B) DBR is a collection of software components optimized for the Databricks platform**
   - Databricks Runtime includes Apache Spark plus additional optimizations, libraries, and integrations specific to the Databricks platform.

5. **C) By setting permissions in the notebook's sharing settings**
   - Notebooks can be shared with specific users or groups by configuring permissions in the notebook's sharing settings.

6. **C) Terminating a cluster stops all running operations and releases compute resources**
   - When you terminate a cluster, it stops all running operations and releases the compute resources. It does not delete any data or notebooks.

7. **B) %run command**
   - The `%run` command allows you to execute one notebook from within another notebook, making the variables and functions from the called notebook available in the calling notebook.

8. **B) It enables proper Git operations such as branching and merging**
   - Databricks Repos provides full Git functionality, including branching, merging, and collaborative development workflows, which aren't available in the built-in notebook version control.

9. **C) C++**
   - Databricks notebooks natively support Python, SQL, Scala, and R, but not C++.

##### Section 2: ELT with Apache Spark

10. **A) option("header", "true")**
    - When reading a CSV file with a header row, you need to specify `option("header", "true")` to tell Spark to treat the first row as column names.

11. **C) Available only within the current Spark session**
    - Temporary views created with `createOrReplaceTempView()` are only available within the current Spark session and are deleted when the session ends.

12. **C) Common Table Expression (CTE)**
    - Common Table Expressions (CTEs) defined with the `WITH` clause allow you to define auxiliary statements that can be referenced within a larger query.

13. **B) year(timestamp_column)**
    - The `year()` function extracts the year component from a timestamp column in Spark SQL.

14. **B) dropDuplicates(["column1", "column2"])**
    - The `dropDuplicates()` function removes duplicate records based on the specified columns.

15. **B) Records with duplicate values in column_name**
    - This query groups by `column_name` and finds groups with more than one record, which identifies duplicate values in that column.

16. **B) explode()**
    - The `explode()` function transforms each element in an array column into a separate row, maintaining all other columns.

17. **B) from_json()**
    - The `from_json()` function parses a JSON string into a structured column based on a provided schema.

18. **C) PIVOT**
    - The `PIVOT` keyword in Spark SQL converts data from a tall (normalized) format to a wide format.

19. **B) CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION name(param type) RETURNS type RETURN expression**
    - This is the correct syntax for creating a SQL user-defined function in Databricks.

20. **A) CASE WHEN column IS NULL THEN 'Unknown' ELSE column END**
    - To check for NULL values in SQL, you must use the `IS NULL` operator, not `= NULL`.

21. **B) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY product_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)**
    - This query counts how many product_id values appear more than once. If the result is 0, then all product_id values are unique.

##### Section 3: Incremental Data Processing

22. **B) Concurrency**
    - The ACID properties are Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. Concurrency is a related concept but not one of the core ACID properties.

23. **C) When a managed table is dropped, both data and metadata are deleted**
    - The key difference is that dropping a managed table deletes both the data and metadata, while dropping an external table only deletes the metadata, leaving the data intact.

24. **B) DESCRIBE HISTORY table_name**
    - The `DESCRIBE HISTORY` command shows the history of operations performed on a Delta table.

25. **C) To co-locate related data in the same files**
    - Z-ordering co-locates related data within files, improving query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be read for certain queries.

26. **B) Permanently removes files no longer needed by the table**
    - The `VACUUM` command permanently removes files that are no longer needed by the table based on the retention period.

27. **B) ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN tax DOUBLE GENERATED ALWAYS AS (price * 0.07)**
    - This command adds a generated column that automatically calculates tax as 7% of the price.

28. **A) CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE can change the schema, while INSERT OVERWRITE preserves it**
    - `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` can create a table with a different schema, while `INSERT OVERWRITE` preserves the existing schema and only replaces the data.

29. **C) For upserting data (update + insert in a single operation)**
    - The `MERGE` command allows you to perform both update and insert operations in a single atomic transaction, commonly known as an upsert.

30. **A) It automatically detects and skips previously loaded files**
    - The `COPY INTO` command tracks which files have been loaded and automatically skips them in subsequent runs, making it idempotent.

31. **B) Auto Loader**
    - Auto Loader is designed to efficiently process new files as they arrive without having to list all files in a directory.

32. **B) Drops records that violate the constraint**
    - The `@dlt.expect_or_drop` annotation drops individual records that violate the specified constraint.

33. **B) To process CDC data and apply changes to a target table**
    - The `APPLY CHANGES INTO` operation processes Change Data Capture (CDC) data and applies the changes (inserts, updates, deletes) to a target table.

##### Section 4: Production Pipelines

34. **C) They organize complex workflows with dependencies between tasks**
    - Multi-task workflows allow you to organize complex data pipelines with clearly defined dependencies between tasks.

35. **B) The dependent tasks will not run**
    - If a task fails in a multi-task job, any tasks that depend on it will not run.

36. **A) 30 3 * * 1**
    - In CRON expressions, the format is `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`. `30 3 * * 1` means 3:30 AM every Monday (1 represents Monday).

37. **B) Using the dbutils.jobs.taskValues API**
    - The `dbutils.jobs.taskValues` API allows tasks to share values with downstream tasks in a multi-task workflow.

38. **A) retry_on_failure: { max_retries: 3, min_duration_between_retries_seconds: 60 }**
    - This is the correct configuration for automatically retrying a task if it fails, with up to 3 retries and a 60-second delay between attempts.

39. **B) By adding email addresses to the job's notification settings**
    - Email notifications for jobs are configured in the job's notification settings, where you can specify email addresses to be notified on success or failure.

##### Section 5: Data Governance

40. **B) catalog.schema.table**
    - The three-level namespace in Unity Catalog is represented as `catalog.schema.table`.

41. **B) The top-level container that holds catalogs**
    - In Unity Catalog, a metastore is the top-level container that holds catalogs, which in turn hold schemas (databases).

42. **B) For automated processes and scheduled jobs**
    - Service principals should be used for automated processes and scheduled jobs rather than interactive user actions.

43. **C) Unity Catalog-enabled mode**
    - Clusters must be in Unity Catalog-enabled mode to access data governed by Unity Catalog.

44. **B) GRANT SELECT ON TABLE catalog.schema.table TO user@example.com**
    - The `GRANT SELECT` command gives a user permission to query (read) a table.

45. **C) Segregating data by business unit across different catalogs**
    - A best practice for organizing data in Unity Catalog is to segregate data by business unit or department across different catalogs.

    - `regexp_extract()` is the correct function for extracting patterns from strings using regular expressions.

17. **A) `SELECT customer.name FROM customers`**
    - When accessing nested data, dot notation is used to navigate the structure hierarchy.

18. **B) `array_contains(array, value)`**
    - The `array_contains()` function checks whether an array column contains a specific value.

19. **B) `from_json(json_column, schema)`**
    - The `from_json()` function parses a JSON string into a structured column based on the provided schema.

20. **C) To convert data from a long format to a wide format**
    - The PIVOT clause transforms data from a normalized (long) format to a denormalized (wide) format, typically for reporting purposes.

21. **B) `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name(param type) RETURNS type RETURN expression`**
    - This is the correct syntax for creating a SQL user-defined function in Databricks.

#### Section 3: Incremental Data Processing

22. **C) Reliable data operations even during concurrent modifications**
    - ACID transactions ensure that data operations are reliable and consistent, even when multiple users or processes are modifying the data concurrently.

23. **B) By running `DESCRIBE FORMATTED table_name` and checking the Type property**
    - The `DESCRIBE FORMATTED` or `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` commands show detailed table information, including whether it's managed or external.

24. **B) `SELECT * FROM table_name VERSION AS OF 3`**
    - This is the correct syntax for querying a specific historical version of a Delta table.

25. **C) It improves query performance by co-locating related data**
    - Z-ordering co-locates related data in the same files, improving query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be read.

26. **B) It compacts small files into larger ones**
    - The OPTIMIZE command combines small files into larger ones to improve query performance and reduce file system overhead.

27. **C) 30 days**
    - By default, Delta Lake retains 30 days of transaction history, which can be adjusted using table properties.

28. **B) Generated columns are stored physically in the table**
    - Generated columns are computed at write time and stored physically in the table, not calculated at query time.

29. **B) When you want to completely replace the data with a new dataset**
    - INSERT OVERWRITE is best used when you want to replace all data in a table or partition, while preserving the schema.

30. **C) It loads only new files that haven't been processed yet**
    - COPY INTO tracks which files have been loaded and automatically skips previously processed files, making it idempotent.

31. **A) A target database and notebook libraries**
    - To create a Delta Live Tables pipeline, you need to specify a target database and notebook libraries containing the transformation logic.

32. **B) Continuous pipelines have lower latency but higher cost**
    - Continuous pipelines process data as it arrives (lower latency) but consume more resources (higher cost) than triggered pipelines.

33. **A) The entire pipeline fails**
    - By default, a constraint violation causes the entire pipeline to fail unless explicitly configured otherwise.

##### Section 4: Production Pipelines

34. **B) They allow defining dependencies between tasks**
    - Multi-task workflows enable you to define complex data pipelines with clear dependencies between tasks.

35. **B) Task B does not run**
    - If a task fails, all dependent tasks will not run, maintaining the integrity of the workflow.

36. **A) `15 * * * *`**
    - In CRON syntax, this expression means "at minute 15 of every hour," following the pattern: minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week.

37. **B) In the job's run history section**
    - You can review a task's execution details, logs, and performance in the job's run history section.

38. **A) To automatically retry the task if it fails due to transient issues**
    - Retry policies allow tasks to automatically retry after failure, which is useful for handling transient issues like network problems.

39. **A) By configuring email notifications in the job settings**
    - Email notifications for job failures can be configured in the job settings, specifying recipients and conditions.

##### Section 5: Data Governance

40. **B) A unified governance solution for data, analytics, and AI**
    - Unity Catalog provides a centralized governance solution across clouds, workspaces, and the full range of data assets.

41. **B) A metastore contains catalogs, which contain schemas**
    - In Unity Catalog, the hierarchy is: metastore â†’ catalogs â†’ schemas (databases) â†’ objects.

42. **B) A non-human identity used for automated processes**
    - Service principals are non-human identities used for automated processes and applications rather than individual users.

43. **C) Unity Catalog-enabled mode**
    - Clusters must be in Unity Catalog-enabled mode to access data governed by Unity Catalog.

44. **B) Using the `GRANT` command to assign permissions to users and groups**
    - Access control in Unity Catalog is implemented using GRANT commands to assign permissions to specific securable objects.

45. **C) Segregating business units across different catalogs**
    - A best practice for Unity Catalog deployment is to organize data by business unit or department across different catalogs.

### Comprehensive Review and Preparation Strategy

#### Key Exam Strategies

1. **Time Management**:
   - You have 90 minutes to answer 45 questions, which gives you approximately 2 minutes per question
   - Don't spend too much time on difficult questions; mark them and come back later
   - Complete a first pass through all questions, then review any marked questions

2. **Question Analysis**:
   - Read each question carefully to identify what is being asked
   - Pay attention to key words like "NOT", "EXCEPT", "PRIMARY" that can change the meaning of a question
   - Eliminate obviously incorrect answers first to narrow down your choices

3. **Technical Focus Areas**:
   - Delta Lake operations and when to use them
   - Incremental data loading patterns (MERGE, COPY INTO, etc.)
   - Unity Catalog structure and permissions
   - Databricks Jobs configuration and dependencies

4. **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**:
   - Confusing temporary views with persistent tables
   - Mixing up the syntax for different SQL operations
   - Forgetting the three-level namespace structure in Unity Catalog
   - Misunderstanding when to use different incremental loading patterns

#### Final Preparation Checklist

âœ… **Review all exam sections**, especially those where you scored lower on practice exams
âœ… **Memorize key commands and syntax** for common operations
âœ… **Understand the core concepts** behind each technology rather than just memorizing facts
âœ… **Practice time management** to ensure you can complete all questions
âœ… **Get a good night's sleep** before the exam
âœ… **Arrive early** if taking the exam at a testing center, or ensure your environment is ready for online proctoring
