- **Parameters & Metrics**: Track and compare model configurations and performance

**Essential Operations:**
- Manual logging of parameters, metrics, and models
- Accessing experiment data programmatically
- Advanced tracking with model signatures and input examples
- Nested runs for complex workflows

---

### Exercise 1: Delta Lake Operations

```python
# 1. Create a Delta table
data = spark.range(0, 1000).withColumn("square", col("id") * col("id"))
data.write.format("delta").save("/path/to/delta-table")

# 2. Read from Delta table
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/path/to/delta-table")

# 3. Update Delta table (append new data)
new_data = spark.range(1000, 2000).withColumn("square", col("id") * col("id"))
new_data.write.format("delta").mode("append").save("/path/to/delta-table")

# 4. View table history
from delta.tables import DeltaTable
delta_table = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/path/to/delta-table")
history = delta_table.history()
display(history)

# 5. Time travel (load previous version)
previous_df = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 0).load("/path/to/delta-table")

# 6. Optimize table (Z-ordering)
spark.sql("OPTIMIZE delta.`/path/to/delta-table` ZORDER BY (id)")
```

---

### Exercise 2: Feature Store Operations

```python
# 1. Initialize Feature Store client
from databricks.feature_store import FeatureStoreClient
fs = FeatureStoreClient()

# 2. Create a feature table
from databricks.feature_store import feature_table
features_df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/path/to/data")

fs.create_table(
    name="customer_features",
    primary_keys=["customer_id"],
    df=features_df,
    description="Customer features for churn prediction"
)

# 3. Write to an existing feature table
fs.write_table(
    name="customer_features",
    df=updated_features_df,
    mode="merge"  # Supports "overwrite" and "merge"
)

# 4. Read from a feature table
features = fs.read_table(
    name="customer_features"
)

# 5. Use features in model training
from databricks.feature_store import FeatureLookup

feature_lookups = [
    FeatureLookup(
        table_name="customer_features",
        feature_names=["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"],
        lookup_key="customer_id"
    )
]

training_data = fs.create_training_set(
    df=training_labels_df,
    feature_lookups=feature_lookups,
    label="churn"
)

# Get the training DataFrame
training_df = training_data.load_df()
```

---

### Exercise 3: MLflow Experiment Tracking

```python
# 1. Basic MLflow tracking
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Start a run
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="rf-classifier") as run:
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", 100)
    mlflow.log_param("max_depth", 5)
    
    # Train model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Log metrics
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
    
    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
    
    # Get run ID for later reference
    run_id = run.info.run_id

# 2. Advanced MLflow tracking with signatures and input examples
import pandas as pd
from mlflow.models.signature import infer_signature

# Create an input example
input_example = X_train.iloc[0:5]

# Infer the model signature
signature = infer_signature(X_train, y_pred)

# Log model with signature and input example
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="rf-with-signature") as run:
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(
        model, 
        "model", 
        signature=signature,
        input_example=input_example
    )

# 3. Working with nested runs
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="parent-run") as parent_run:
    mlflow.log_param("parent_param", "parent_value")
    
    # Create child runs for different model variations
    for n_estimators in [50, 100, 150]:
        with mlflow.start_run(run_name=f"child-run-{n_estimators}", nested=True) as child_run:
            mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", n_estimators)
            
            # Train and log model details
            model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=n_estimators)
            model.fit(X_train, y_train)
            
            accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))
            mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)

#### Quiz Answers

1. **What Delta Lake operation would you use to eliminate small files and optimize performance?**
   **Answer: B) OPTIMIZE**
   
   Explanation: The OPTIMIZE command rewrites small files into larger ones to improve read performance. VACUUM removes old file versions but doesn't consolidate small files. COMPACT isn't a standard Delta operation, and CLEAN doesn't exist in Delta Lake.

2. **In the Feature Store, what mode should you use when writing updates to an existing feature table for specific keys?**
   **Answer: C) "merge"**
   
   Explanation: The "merge" mode updates existing records based on primary keys and inserts new ones. "Overwrite" would replace the entire table, "append" would add duplicate records, and "update" isn't a standard mode in Feature Store.

3. **How would you access a Delta table's version from 3 days ago?**
   **Answer: B) Using option("timestampAsOf", timestamp)**
   
   Explanation: To access a version from a specific time point, you use the "timestampAsOf" option with a timestamp value. "versionAsOf" is used for specific version numbers, not time periods. The other options don't exist in Delta Lake.

4. **When tracking experiments with MLflow, what does setting nested=True allow you to do?**
   **Answer: A) Create hierarchical runs for different model configurations**
   
   Explanation: The nested=True parameter allows you to create child runs within a parent run, which is useful for organizing related experiments (like testing different hyperparameters of the same model type).

5. **Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using the Databricks Feature Store?**
   **Answer: B) Automatic feature selection**
   
   Explanation: Feature Store doesn't automatically select optimal features for your models. It does provide feature sharing, discovery (finding features in the organization), and point-in-time lookups (accessing feature values as they were at a specific time).

6. **What information is provided by a model signature in MLflow?**
   **Answer: B) The input and output schema of the model**
   
   Explanation: A model signature defines the expected data types and shapes for model inputs and outputs, enabling validation when the model is used for inference.

7. **Which MLflow tracking function would you use to save metadata about a trained model?**
   **Answer: C) log_param()**
   
   Explanation: log_param() saves named parameters about your model (like hyperparameters). log_metric() is for performance metrics, log_artifact() is for files, and log_tags() isn't a standard MLflow function.

8. **What operation can you perform to go back to a previous version of a Delta table?**
   **Answer: C) Read with option("versionAsOf", N) and rewrite**
   
   Explanation: Delta Lake doesn't have a direct rollback command. To restore a previous version, you need to read the table at that version using "versionAsOf" and then write it back to replace the current version.

9. **When using the FeatureStoreClient to create a training set, what does the FeatureLookup parameter do?**
   **Answer: B) Specifies which features to retrieve and how to join them**
   
   Explanation: FeatureLookup specifies which features to retrieve from which feature tables and how to join them with the training dataset based on lookup keys.

10. **How can you programmatically retrieve the metrics from a previous MLflow run?**
    **Answer: A) mlflow.get_run(run_id).data.metrics**
    
    Explanation: You can get a run's details with mlflow.get_run() and then access its metrics via the .data.metrics attribute. This returns a dictionary of all logged metrics from that run.

    def predict(self, context, model_input):
        # Add preprocessing logic
        if isinstance(model_input, pd.DataFrame):
            # Scale numeric features
            numeric_cols = model_input.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns
            model_input[numeric_cols] = model_input[numeric_cols] - model_input[numeric_cols].mean()
            model_input[numeric_cols] = model_input[numeric_cols] / model_input[numeric_cols].std()

#### Quiz Answers

1. **Which MLflow flavor would you use to create a model with custom preprocessing logic?**
   **Answer: C) mlflow.pyfunc**
   
   Explanation: The mlflow.pyfunc flavor allows you to create custom Python models by extending the PythonModel class, enabling you to implement custom preprocessing logic in the predict() method. The other flavors are for specific frameworks (sklearn) or don't exist (custom, generic).

2. **What happens when you register a model that already exists in the Model Registry?**
   **Answer: B) It creates a new version of the model**
   
   Explanation: When registering a model with a name that already exists in the registry, MLflow creates a new version under that name rather than overwriting the existing model or returning an error.

3. **Which of the following is NOT a standard stage in the MLflow Model Registry?**
   **Answer: A) Development**
   
   Explanation: The standard stages in the MLflow Model Registry are None (default), Staging, Production, and Archived. "Development" is not a standard stage.

4. **When creating a webhook for model registry events, which of these is NOT a valid event type?**
   **Answer: D) MODEL_VERSION_DEPLOYED**
   
   Explanation: Valid event types include MODEL_VERSION_CREATED, MODEL_VERSION_TRANSITIONED_STAGE, and REGISTERED_MODEL_CREATED. MODEL_VERSION_DEPLOYED is not a standard event type in MLflow webhooks.

5. **What is the correct way to load a production model from the registry?**
   **Answer: D) mlflow.pyfunc.load_model("models:/model_name/Production")**
   
   Explanation: The correct URI format is "models:/model_name/stage" and the stage name is case-sensitive, with "Production" being the proper casing. MLflow's pyfunc loader is the universal way to load any model.

6. **What is the purpose of adding a model signature to an MLflow model?**
   **Answer: B) Define the expected input and output schema**
   
   Explanation: A model signature in MLflow defines the expected data types and shapes for inputs and outputs, allowing for validation when the model is used for inference.

7. **Which client method is used to move a model from Staging to Production?**
   **Answer: C) client.transition_model_version_stage()**
   
   Explanation: The transition_model_version_stage() method of the MLflowClient is used to change a model version's stage (e.g., from Staging to Production). The other methods don't exist in the MLflow API.

8. **What would you include in a pyfunc model's predict() method to implement custom preprocessing?**
   **Answer: A) Data cleaning and feature transformation logic before passing to the model**
   
   Explanation: The predict() method in a custom pyfunc model is where you implement preprocessing logic like data cleaning and feature transformations before passing the data to the underlying model.

9. **What is the correct API to add a description to a model version?**
   **Answer: B) client.update_model_version()**
   
   Explanation: The update_model_version() method is used to update metadata for a specific model version, including its description. The other options are not valid MLflow API methods.

10. **What type of compute is recommended for production Databricks Jobs?**
    **Answer: B) Job clusters**
    
    Explanation: Job clusters are purpose-built for production workloads in Databricks. They start when a job begins and terminate when it completes, optimizing costs. All-purpose clusters are for interactive work, not production jobs.

### Exercise 1: Batch Deployment with Spark UDFs

```python
# 1. Load a registered model for batch inference
import mlflow
import pandas as pd
from pyspark.sql.functions import struct, col

# Load the model from the registry
model_uri = "models:/RandomForestRegressor/Production"
model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri)

# 2. Create a Pandas UDF for batch inference
from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf
from pyspark.sql.types import DoubleType

# Define the UDF using the loaded model
@pandas_udf(DoubleType())
def predict_udf(features_pd: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    # Make predictions
    return pd.Series(model.predict(features_pd.to_frame().T))

# 3. Apply the UDF to a DataFrame
# Assuming df has feature columns feature1, feature2, etc.
predictions_df = df.withColumn(
    "prediction", 
    predict_udf(struct(*[col(c) for c in feature_cols]))
)

# 4. Create a Spark UDF for distributed inference
# This approach is more efficient for large-scale inference
spark_udf = mlflow.pyfunc.spark_udf(
    spark=spark, 
    model_uri=model_uri,
    result_type=DoubleType()
)

# Apply the Spark UDF
predictions_df = df.withColumn(
    "prediction",
    spark_udf(struct(*[col(c) for c in feature_cols]))
)

# 5. Optimize batch inference with partitioning
# First, save predictions to a Delta table
predictions_df.write.format("delta") \
    .partitionBy("date_col") \
    .mode("append") \
    .save("/path/to/predictions")

# Optimize with Z-ordering for faster queries
spark.sql("""
OPTIMIZE delta.`/path/to/predictions`
ZORDER BY (customer_id)
""")

# 6. Use Feature Store batch scoring
from databricks.feature_store import FeatureStoreClient

fs = FeatureStoreClient()

# Score batch of data using a registered model and features from Feature Store
batch_df = fs.score_batch(
    model_uri=model_uri,
    df=inference_df,
    feature_lookups=[
        FeatureLookup(
            table_name="customer_features",
            feature_names=["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"],
            lookup_key="customer_id"
        )
    ]
)
```

---

### Exercise 2: Streaming Deployment

```python
# 1. Set up a streaming data source
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, from_json
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, DoubleType

# Define the schema of the streaming data
schema = StructType([
    StructField("customer_id", StringType(), True),
    StructField("feature1", DoubleType(), True),
    StructField("feature2", DoubleType(), True),
    StructField("feature3", DoubleType(), True),
    StructField("timestamp", StringType(), True)
])

# Read from a streaming source (e.g., Kafka)
streaming_df = spark.readStream \
    .format("kafka") \
    .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "host:port") \
    .option("subscribe", "input_topic") \
    .load() \
    .select(from_json(col("value").cast("string"), schema).alias("data")) \
    .select("data.*")

# 2. Load the model for streaming inference
import mlflow

model_uri = "models:/RandomForestRegressor/Production"
model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri)

# 3. Apply the model using a UDF
from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, struct
from pyspark.sql.types import DoubleType
import pandas as pd

# Define the UDF
@pandas_udf(DoubleType())
def predict_udf(features_pd: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    # Make predictions
    return pd.Series(model.predict(features_pd.to_frame().T))

# Apply the UDF to the streaming DataFrame
feature_cols = ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"]
predictions_streaming_df = streaming_df.withColumn(
    "prediction", 
    predict_udf(struct(*[col(c) for c in feature_cols]))
)

# 4. Write predictions to a streaming sink
query = predictions_streaming_df \
    .writeStream \
    .format("delta") \
    .outputMode("append") \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/path/to/checkpoint") \
    .start("/path/to/streaming_predictions")

# 5. Alternative: Use a foreachBatch function for more control
def process_batch(batch_df, batch_id):
    # Additional processing specific to each batch
    processed_df = batch_df.withColumn("batch_id", lit(batch_id))
    
    # Write to Delta table
    processed_df.write.format("delta").mode("append").save("/path/to/predictions")

streaming_query = predictions_streaming_df \
    .writeStream \
    .foreachBatch(process_batch) \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/path/to/checkpoint") \
    .trigger(processingTime="1 minute") \
    .start()

# 6. Handle watermarking for late data
windowed_df = streaming_df \
    .withWatermark("timestamp", "10 minutes") \
    .groupBy(
        window(col("timestamp"), "5 minutes"),
        col("customer_id")
    ) \
    .agg(avg("feature1").alias("avg_feature1"))

# Then apply model to windowed data...
```

### Exercise 3: Real-time Model Serving

```python
# Note: Much of the real-time serving setup is done through the Databricks UI or REST API
# Here's a conceptual guide for the key operations:

# 1. Enable Model Serving for a registered model
# Through UI: Go to Model Registry -> Select model -> Serving tab -> Enable serving

# Or programmatically via REST API:
"""
curl -X POST https://<databricks-instance>/api/2.0/serving-endpoints \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -d '{
           "name": "rf-prediction-endpoint",
           "config": {
             "served_models": [{
               "model_name": "RandomForestRegressor",
               "model_version": "1",
               "workload_size": "Small",
               "scale_to_zero_enabled": true
             }]
           }
         }'
"""

# 2. Query the model endpoint programmatically
import requests
import json

def query_endpoint(endpoint_name, input_data):
    url = f"https://<databricks-instance>/serving-endpoints/{endpoint_name}/invocations"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer <token>",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data_json = json.dumps({
        "dataframe_records": input_data
    })
    
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data_json)
    return response.json()

# Example input data
input_data = [
    {"feature1": 0.5, "feature2": 0.2, "feature3": 0.8}
]

# Get predictions
predictions = query_endpoint("rf-prediction-endpoint", input_data)
print(predictions)

# 3. Integration with Feature Store for online serving
# First, ensure your Feature Store table is published for online serving
"""
# This would be done through the Feature Store UI or API
fs.publish_table(
    name="customer_features",
    online=True
)
"""

# Then, when making real-time predictions, include feature lookup
def query_with_features(endpoint_name, lookup_keys):
    url = f"https://<databricks-instance>/serving-endpoints/{endpoint_name}/invocations"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer <token>",

            {
                "table_name": "customer_features",
                "lookup_key": "customer_id"
            }
        ]
    })
    
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data_json)
    return response.json()

# Example lookup keys
lookup_keys = ["customer_123", "customer_456"]

#### Quiz Answers

1. **Which deployment pattern is most appropriate for generating predictions for millions of customers once per day?**
   **Answer: B) Batch inference**
   
   Explanation: Batch inference is ideal for high-volume, scheduled processing where predictions don't need to be generated in real-time. Running predictions for millions of customers once daily is a classic batch inference scenario.

2. **What is the primary advantage of using mlflow.pyfunc.spark_udf() over a regular pandas UDF?**
   **Answer: B) It distributes the model across the cluster efficiently**
   
   Explanation: The spark_udf function from MLflow efficiently distributes model inference across a Spark cluster, allowing for better parallelization and throughput compared to a standard pandas UDF implementation.

3. **When implementing a streaming inference pipeline, what Spark feature helps deal with late-arriving data?**
   **Answer: B) Watermarking**
   
   Explanation: Watermarking in Spark Structured Streaming allows you to specify how late data can arrive and still be processed, which is essential for handling out-of-order data in streaming pipelines.

4. **What is NOT a typical use case for real-time model serving?**
   **Answer: C) Daily customer churn prediction reports**
   
   Explanation: Daily churn prediction reports are a batch processing use case, not requiring real-time serving. The other options (fraud detection, real-time recommendations, and instant credit decisions) all require immediate responses and are suitable for real-time serving.

5. **Which method allows the most efficient batch scoring using features from the Feature Store?**
   **Answer: B) fs.score_batch()**
   
   Explanation: The score_batch() method from the FeatureStoreClient is specifically designed for efficient batch scoring with features from the Feature Store, handling the feature lookups and model prediction in an optimized way.

6. **What is a benefit of Z-ordering a Delta table containing model predictions?**
   **Answer: B) It enables faster queries on specific columns**
   
   Explanation: Z-ordering co-locates related data in the same files, allowing for more efficient data skipping during queries, which significantly speeds up queries that filter on the Z-ordered columns.

7. **When converting a batch inference pipeline to streaming, what component must be changed?**
   **Answer: B) The input data source and potentially the output sink**
   
   Explanation: To convert a batch pipeline to streaming, you must change how data is read (using readStream instead of read) and how results are written (using writeStream instead of write). The model itself doesn't necessarily change.

8. **What is the recommended way to handle state information in a streaming model inference pipeline?**
   **Answer: B) Use Spark's stateful processing with watermarking**
   
   Explanation: Spark Structured Streaming provides built-in stateful processing capabilities, which, when combined with watermarking, allow for proper handling of state across streaming micro-batches.

9. **Which Databricks feature enables scaling real-time model serving to zero when not in use?**
   **Answer: B) Scale-to-Zero**
   
   Explanation: Databricks Model Serving includes a Scale-to-Zero feature that allows endpoints to automatically scale down to zero compute when they're not receiving requests, reducing costs.

10. **What's the primary benefit of partitioning a Delta table containing model predictions?**
    **Answer: B) It enables query pruning for faster reads on partition columns**
    
    Explanation: Partitioning a Delta table allows the query optimizer to skip irrelevant partitions (data files) during read operations, significantly improving query performance when filtering on the partition columns.

#### Quiz Answers

1. **What type of drift occurs when the statistical properties of the target variable change over time?**
   **Answer: B) Label drift**
   
   Explanation: Label drift specifically refers to changes in the distribution of the target variable (labels) over time. Feature drift refers to changes in input features, while concept drift refers to changes in the relationship between features and the target.

2. **Which of the following statistical tests is most appropriate for detecting drift in categorical features?**
   **Answer: C) Chi-square test**
   
   Explanation: The Chi-square test is designed for comparing categorical distributions. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Jensen-Shannon are better suited for continuous distributions, while t-tests compare means of continuous variables.

3. **When using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to detect drift, what does a p-value < 0.05 indicate?**
   **Answer: B) The distributions are significantly different**
   
   Explanation: In statistical hypothesis testing, a p-value below the significance level (commonly 0.05) means we reject the null hypothesis, which in the case of the KS test is that the distributions are the same. Therefore, p < 0.05 indicates the distributions are significantly different, suggesting drift.

4. **What is concept drift in the context of machine learning?**
   **Answer: C) When the relationship between input features and target variable changes**
   
   Explanation: Concept drift occurs when the underlying relationship between input features and the target variable changes over time, making the learned patterns less valid. This can happen even when the feature distributions themselves remain stable.

5. **What is NOT a typical response to detected feature drift?**
   **Answer: D) Deleting the features that show drift**
   
   Explanation: Simply deleting drifted features is rarely the right approach, as those features may still contain valuable information. Typical responses include retraining the model, adjusting feature engineering, or reverting to a previous version while investigating.

6. **Which metric is NOT commonly used for monitoring numeric feature drift?**
   **Answer: D) Gini coefficient**
   
   Explanation: The Gini coefficient is primarily used to measure inequality in distributions, particularly in economics. It's not commonly used for feature drift detection. Mean, standard deviation, quantiles, and KS statistics are standard metrics for monitoring numeric features.

7. **What is an advantage of using Jensen-Shannon divergence over Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for drift detection?**
   **Answer: C) Jensen-Shannon is symmetric and bounded between 0 and 1**
   
   Explanation: The Jensen-Shannon divergence has the advantage of being symmetric (the order of distributions doesn't matter) and bounded between 0 and 1, making it easier to interpret and set thresholds. The KS test doesn't have these properties.

8. **In a comprehensive drift detection system, why is it important to monitor both individual features and overall model performance?**
   **Answer: A) Feature drift might not always impact model performance**
   
   Explanation: Feature drift doesn't always translate to degraded model performance, as the model might be robust to certain changes or the drift might occur in less important features. Monitoring both gives a more complete picture of system health.

9. **What is a valid approach to evaluate if a retrained model is better than the current production model?**
   **Answer: B) Compare their performance on the most recent production data**
   
   Explanation: The most valid approach is to compare both models on the most recent production data, as this reflects the current reality the model will face. Using the original training data would be inappropriate as it doesn't represent current conditions.

10. **Which approach is NOT recommended for handling missing categories in categorical feature drift detection?**
    **Answer: A) Ignore new categories that weren't in the training data**
    
    Explanation: Ignoring new categories that appear in production but weren't in training data is not recommended, as these new categories often represent significant drift and should be accounted for in drift detection. The other approaches are valid techniques for handling categorical comparisons.
