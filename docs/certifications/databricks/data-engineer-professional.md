## Fundamentals & Databricks Tooling

### Introduction to Databricks Platform and Delta Lake Fundamentals

#### 1. Introduction to Databricks Platform Architecture

The Databricks platform is built on a cloud-native architecture that separates control and data planes, providing both security and performance benefits.

**Key Components:**

The Databricks platform architecture consists of two primary planes:

1. **Control Plane**
   - Managed by Databricks
   - Handles authentication, authorization, job scheduling, and notebook orchestration
   - Stores metadata about clusters, notebooks, and jobs
   - Provides web UI for managing resources

2. **Data Plane**
   - Resides in the customer's cloud account (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - Contains the compute clusters that process data
   - Stores data in cloud storage (S3, ADLS, GCS)
   - Isolates customer data from Databricks infrastructure

**Interaction Between Planes:**
- Control plane initiates and manages clusters in the data plane
- Data remains within your cloud account boundaries
- Authentication flows through the control plane to secure access

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Understanding the separation of responsibilities between planes
- Security implications of this architecture
- How resource provisioning works across the planes

---

### 2. Delta Lake Fundamentals and Transaction Log Concepts

Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads.

**Core Delta Lake Components:**

1. **Parquet Files**
   - Base data storage format
   - Columnar storage optimized for analytics
   - Efficient compression and encoding

2. **Transaction Log (_delta_log)**
   - JSON files that track all changes to the table
   - Each transaction creates a new JSON file in the log
   - Numbered sequentially (00000000000000000000.json, 00000000000000000001.json, etc.)
   - Contains complete record of all operations (add, remove, update files)

3. **Table State**
   - Current state of the table is derived by replaying the transaction log
   - No need to scan all data files to understand table structure
   - Enables time travel and versioned queries

**Transaction Log Deep Dive:**

The transaction log is the backbone of Delta Lake and enables many of its key features:

```
/table_path/
  ├── _delta_log/
  │   ├── 00000000000000000000.json
  │   ├── 00000000000000000001.json
  │   └── ...
  ├── part-00000-abc123.snappy.parquet
  ├── part-00001-def456.snappy.parquet
  └── ...
```

Each transaction log entry contains:
- Operation type (write, commit, etc.)
- Schema information
- Partition information
- Files added/removed
- Operation metadata (user, timestamp, etc.)

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- How Delta Lake uses transaction logs to provide ACID properties
- How to interpret and use transaction log information
- Understanding the relationship between Parquet files and log entries

---

### 3. ACID Properties in Delta Lake

Delta Lake is the first big data storage layer to provide full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees.

**ACID Properties Explained:**

1. **Atomicity**
   - All changes in a transaction are applied completely or not at all
   - Example: If a job fails during a write operation, no partial updates are visible

2. **Consistency**
   - The table is always in a valid state
   - Schema enforcement prevents inconsistent data types
   - Constraints can be applied to ensure data quality

3. **Isolation**
   - Delta Lake uses optimistic concurrency control
   - Multiple readers can access the same table without interference
   - Writers use versioning to prevent conflicts

4. **Durability**
   - Once a transaction is committed, it's permanent
   - Cloud storage provides underlying durability
   - Transaction log ensures recoverability

**Optimistic Concurrency Control:**

Delta Lake uses optimistic concurrency control (OCC) rather than locking:
- Writers read the current table state from the transaction log
- Changes are prepared based on that state
- Before committing, the system checks if the table state has changed
- If not, changes are committed; if yes, the operation retries or fails

**Which transactions might conflict?**
- Concurrent schema changes
- Concurrent writes to the same partition
- Operations that modify the same files

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- How Delta Lake implements each ACID property
- Understanding optimistic concurrency control
- Identifying which operations might conflict

### 4. Hands-on: Creating and Optimizing Delta Tables

Let's walk through how to create and perform basic operations with Delta tables.

**Creating a Delta Table:**

```python
# Creating a Delta table from a DataFrame
df = spark.read.csv("/path/to/data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df.write.format("delta").save("/path/to/delta-table")

# Creating a Delta table using SQL
spark.sql("""
CREATE TABLE my_delta_table
USING DELTA
LOCATION '/path/to/delta-table'
AS SELECT * FROM source_table
""")
```

**Basic Operations:**

```python
# Reading a Delta table
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/path/to/delta-table")

# Updating data
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/path/to/delta-table")
deltaTable.update(
  condition = "id = 100",
  set = { "value": "'new_value'" }
)

# Time travel query
df_previous_version = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 1).load("/path/to/delta-table")
```

**Delta Table History:**

```python
# View table history
deltaTable.history().show()
```

**Delta Table Details:**

```python
# Detailed information about the table
deltaTable.detail().show()
```

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Different ways to create Delta tables
- Understanding basic operations (read, write, update, delete)
- How to use time travel and history functions

---

### 5. Delta Lake Optimization Techniques

Delta Lake offers several optimization techniques to improve query performance and efficiency.

**File Optimization: OPTIMIZE Command**

The `OPTIMIZE` command compacts small files into larger ones:

```sql
-- Basic OPTIMIZE command
OPTIMIZE my_delta_table

-- OPTIMIZE with Z-ORDER
OPTIMIZE my_delta_table ZORDER BY (column1, column2)
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces the number of files that need to be processed
- Improves scan efficiency
- Decreases metadata overhead

**Partitioning Delta Tables:**

```sql
-- Creating a partitioned table
CREATE TABLE sales_data
USING DELTA
PARTITIONED BY (date)
LOCATION '/path/to/sales_data'
AS SELECT * FROM source_data

-- Writing to a partitioned table from DataFrame
df.write.format("delta")
  .partitionBy("date")
  .save("/path/to/sales_data")
```

**Partitioning Best Practices:**
- Choose columns with high cardinality but not too high (hundreds to thousands of unique values)
- Consider query patterns (filter columns are good partition candidates)
- Avoid over-partitioning, which creates too many small files
- Typically use date/time dimensions, region, or category columns

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- When and how to partition data
- Trade-offs in partition design decisions
- How to optimize existing tables

---

### 6. Z-Ordering and Advanced Indexing

Z-ordering is a multi-dimensional clustering technique that helps co-locate related data.

**Z-Ordering Example:**

```sql
-- Apply Z-ORDER to specific columns
OPTIMIZE my_delta_table ZORDER BY (customer_id, product_id)
```

**How Z-Ordering Works:**
- Groups related records together based on column values
- Enables data skipping during queries
- Particularly effective for high-cardinality columns

**Z-Order vs. Partitioning:**
- Partitioning: Physical separation of data
- Z-ordering: Logical organization within files
- Partitioning works at file level; Z-ordering works within files
- Use both together for optimal performance

**Data Skipping:**

Delta Lake automatically collects statistics on data files:
- Min/max values for columns
- NULL counts
- Approximate count distinct

These statistics enable the query optimizer to skip files that can't contain matching data.

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- When to use Z-ordering vs. partitioning
- How to choose columns for Z-ordering
- Understanding data skipping mechanisms

---

### 7. Delta Clone Operations and Use Cases

Delta clone creates a copy of a Delta table with minimal data duplication.

**Types of Clones:**

1. **Shallow Clone**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE clone_table
   SHALLOW CLONE source_table
   ```
   - Creates a reference to source table files
   - Independent transaction logs
   - Changes to either table don't affect the other
   - Very fast, minimal storage overhead

2. **Deep Clone**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE clone_table
   DEEP CLONE source_table
   ```
   - Copies both data files and transaction log
   - Completely independent from source
   - Higher storage overhead but full isolation

**Common Use Cases:**
- Testing data modifications without affecting source data
- Creating development/test environments
- Sharing data snapshots with other teams
- Backup and disaster recovery strategies

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Differences between shallow and deep clones
- When to use each type of clone
- How clones interact with the source table

---

### 8. Bloom Filters and File Size Optimization

**Bloom Filters:**

Bloom filters are a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.

```sql
-- Create a bloom filter index
CREATE BLOOMFILTER INDEX
ON TABLE my_delta_table
FOR COLUMNS(customer_id OPTIONS (fpp=0.1, numItems=10000000))
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster point lookups
- Reduced I/O for selective queries
- Complement to Z-ordering for high-cardinality columns

**File Size Optimization:**

Optimizing file sizes is crucial for Spark performance:
- Target file size: 128MB - 1GB
- Too small: High metadata overhead
- Too large: Inefficient parallelism

**Controlling File Size:**
```python
# Using repartition to control number of files
df.repartition(8).write.format("delta").save("/path/to/table")

# Using coalesce for fewer files
df.coalesce(4).write.format("delta").save("/path/to/table")
```

**Auto Optimize:**
```sql
-- Enable auto optimization for a table
ALTER TABLE my_delta_table SET TBLPROPERTIES(
  'delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite' = 'true',
  'delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact' = 'true'
)
```

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- When to use Bloom filters
- How to configure optimal file sizes
- Trade-offs in file size decisions
- Auto optimization settings

## Data Processing

### 1. Batch Processing Fundamentals

Batch processing is the foundation of data engineering in Databricks, enabling the processing of large volumes of data in defined intervals.

**Core Batch Processing Concepts:**

**Batch vs. Streaming:**
- Batch processing works with bounded, complete datasets
- Processing occurs at scheduled intervals or trigger events
- Results are typically written to persistent storage

**Apache Spark Execution Model:**

Understanding Spark's execution model is crucial for optimizing batch jobs:

1. **Logical Plan:** DataFrame operations create a logical plan
2. **Physical Plan:** Catalyst optimizer converts logical plan to physical execution plan
3. **Tasks:** Physical plan is divided into stages and tasks
4. **Execution:** Tasks are distributed across the cluster

**Transformations and Actions:**
- **Transformations:** Operations that create a new DataFrame (lazy evaluation)
  - Examples: `select()`, `filter()`, `groupBy()`
- **Actions:** Operations that trigger computation and return results
  - Examples: `count()`, `collect()`, `write()`

**Job → Stage → Task Hierarchy:**
- **Job:** Triggered by an action
- **Stage:** Created when data needs to be shuffled
- **Task:** Individual unit of work on a partition

**Key Performance Metrics:**
- **Job Duration:** Total time to complete all operations
- **Stage Duration:** Time to complete a specific stage
- **Task Duration:** Time for individual tasks (look for skew)
- **Shuffle Read/Write:** Amount of data transferred between executors

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Understanding Spark's execution model
- Differentiating between transformations and actions
- Interpreting performance metrics

---

### 2. Spark Partitioning Strategies and Optimization

Effective partitioning is critical for Spark performance optimization.

**Partitioning Fundamentals:**

- **Partition:** Logical chunk of data processed by one task
- **Parallelism:** Number of partitions determines degree of parallelism
- **Data Skew:** Uneven distribution of data across partitions

**Partitioning Strategies:**

1. **Input Partitioning:**
   - How data is initially divided when read
   - Affected by file format, size, and storage system
   
2. **Processing Partitioning:**
   - How data is organized during computation
   - Controlled by shuffle operations
   
3. **Output Partitioning:**
   - How data is organized when written
   - Affects future query performance

**Ideal Partition Size:**
- Target: 128MB - 1GB per partition
- Too small: High scheduling overhead
- Too large: Inefficient memory usage, potential OOM errors

**Handling Data Skew:**

Data skew occurs when certain partitions contain significantly more data than others:

1. **Identify Skew:**
   - Examine task durations in Spark UI
   - Look for outliers in task metrics
   
2. **Mitigate Skew:**
   - Salting/key normalization for skewed join keys
   - Custom partitioning for known skewed columns
   - Broadcasting small datasets for joins

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- How to determine optimal partition counts
- Techniques for identifying and resolving data skew
- Impact of partitioning on shuffle operations

---

### 3. Partition Hints: Coalesce, Repartition, Rebalance

Spark provides several mechanisms to control partitioning during processing.

**Repartition vs. Coalesce:**

1. **Repartition:**
   ```python
   # Repartition to 200 partitions
   df = df.repartition(200)
   
   # Repartition by specific column(s)
   df = df.repartition(200, "customer_id")
   ```
   - Full shuffle (expensive)
   - Can increase or decrease partition count
   - Distributes data evenly
   - Use when need to increase partitions or balance data

2. **Coalesce:**
   ```python
   # Reduce to 50 partitions
   df = df.coalesce(50)
   ```
   - Avoids full shuffle when reducing partitions
   - Can only reduce partition count, not increase
   - May result in uneven partitions
   - More efficient than repartition for reducing partitions

**Repartition by Range:**
```python
# Repartition by range of values
df = df.repartitionByRange(200, "timestamp")
```
- Ensures similar ranges of values go to the same partition
- Useful for time-series data
- Creates more evenly distributed partitions for ordered data

**Rebalance:**
```python
# Available in Databricks Runtime (not in open-source Spark)
df = df.rebalance()
```
- Adaptive redistribution of data
- Less expensive than full repartition
- Used to correct skew without specifying partition count

**When to Use Each Approach:**

| Operation | When to Use | Cost | Effect on Skew |
|-----------|-------------|------|---------------|
| Repartition | Need specific partition count, even distribution | High | Resolves skew |
| Coalesce | Need to reduce partitions efficiently | Low | May worsen skew |
| RepartitionByRange | Working with ordered data | High | Good for ordered data |
| Rebalance | Need to correct skew adaptively | Medium | Resolves moderate skew |

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Appropriate usage of each partitioning operation
- Performance implications of different partition operations
- How to optimize partition operations

---

### 4. Hands-on: Optimizing Batch Workloads

Let's walk through practical techniques for optimizing batch processing workloads.

**Scenario: Processing Customer Transaction Data**

Consider a large dataset of customer transactions that needs to be processed daily:

```python
# Read raw transaction data
transactions = spark.read.format("delta").load("/data/raw/transactions")

# Initial processing
processed = transactions.filter(transactions.status == "completed") \
                         .join(customers, "customer_id") \
                         .groupBy("customer_id", "date") \
                         .agg(sum("amount").alias("daily_total"))

# Write results
processed.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/data/processed/daily_totals")
```

**Step 1: Analyze the Current Job**

Use the Spark UI to identify bottlenecks:
- Examine stage durations
- Look for skewed tasks
- Check shuffle read/write metrics

**Step 2: Optimize Input**

```python
# Add partition pruning
transactions = spark.read.format("delta") \
                     .load("/data/raw/transactions") \
                     .filter(transactions.date == current_date)

# Broadcast small tables
customers = spark.read.format("delta").load("/data/customers")
broadcast_customers = F.broadcast(customers)
```

**Step 3: Optimize Processing**

```python
# Add appropriate partitioning
processed = transactions.filter(transactions.status == "completed") \
                         .join(broadcast_customers, "customer_id") \
                         .repartition(200, "customer_id") \
                         .groupBy("customer_id", "date") \
                         .agg(sum("amount").alias("daily_total"))
```

**Step 4: Optimize Output**

```python
# Optimize output partitioning
processed.repartition(100) \
         .write.format("delta") \
         .partitionBy("date") \
         .mode("overwrite") \
         .option("dataChange", "false") \
         .save("/data/processed/daily_totals")
```

**Step 5: Implement Caching for Iterative Processing**

```python
# Cache intermediate results when reused
enriched_transactions = transactions.filter(transactions.status == "completed") \
                                   .join(broadcast_customers, "customer_id")
enriched_transactions.cache()

# Use for multiple aggregations
daily_totals = enriched_transactions.groupBy("customer_id", "date") \
                                    .agg(sum("amount").alias("daily_total"))

product_analysis = enriched_transactions.groupBy("product_id") \
                                        .count()

# Unpersist when done
enriched_transactions.unpersist()
```

**Key Optimization Techniques:**

1. **Partition Pruning:** Filter by partition columns early
2. **Join Optimization:** Broadcast small tables
3. **Appropriate Partitioning:** Match partitions to cluster size
4. **Caching:** Cache reused DataFrames
5. **Adaptive Query Execution:** Enable for automatic optimizations
6. **Predicate Pushdown:** Push filters to data source
7. **AQE Skew Join:** Enable adaptive handling of skewed joins

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks
- Implementing appropriate optimization techniques
- Understanding when to use different optimization strategies

### 5. Incremental Processing with Structured Streaming

Structured Streaming brings real-time data processing capabilities to Spark's DataFrame API.

**Structured Streaming Fundamentals:**

**Core Concepts:**
- **Unbounded Table:** Stream is treated as a continuously growing table
- **Trigger:** Controls when to process new data
- **Output Modes:** How results are updated
- **Watermarks:** Handling late data
- **Checkpointing:** Maintaining state between batches

**Stream Sources:**

```python
# Reading from a stream source
stream_df = spark.readStream.format("delta") \
                           .option("maxFilesPerTrigger", 10) \
                           .load("/data/source")
```

Common stream sources:
- Delta Lake tables
- Kafka
- Files in a directory (Auto Loader)
- Event Hubs (Azure)

**Processing Modes:**

1. **Micro-Batch Processing:**
   - Default mode
   - Processes data in small batches
   - Lower latency than traditional batch, higher throughput than continuous

2. **Continuous Processing:**
   - Sub-millisecond latency
   - Limited operation support
   - Lower throughput than micro-batch

**Output Modes:**

1. **Append Mode:**
   ```python
   # Only new rows are written to sink
   query = df.writeStream.outputMode("append")...
   ```
   - Only new results are sent to sink
   - Cannot update previous results
   - Works with all queries

2. **Complete Mode:**
   ```python
   # Full result table is written each time
   query = df.writeStream.outputMode("complete")...
   ```
   - Entire result table is written each time
   - Requires aggregation
   - Higher resource utilization

3. **Update Mode:**
   ```python
   # Only updated rows are written
   query = df.writeStream.outputMode("update")...
   ```
   - Only rows that changed are written
   - Combines benefits of append and complete
   - Not supported by all sinks

**Watermarking:**

```python
# Setting a watermark for handling late data
df = df.withWatermark("event_time", "10 minutes") \
       .groupBy(window("event_time", "5 minutes"), "device") \
       .count()
```
- Defines how late data can arrive
- Enables state cleanup for aggregations
- Essential for managing memory usage in long-running streams

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Understanding streaming concepts and terminology
- Selecting appropriate processing modes and output modes
- Implementing watermarks for late data handling

---

### 6. Stream-Static Joins Implementation

Joining streaming data with static (batch) data is a common pattern in data engineering.

**Types of Stream Joins:**

1. **Stream-Static Join:**
   ```python
   # Static DataFrame
   static_df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/data/static")
   
   # Streaming DataFrame
   stream_df = spark.readStream.format("delta").load("/data/stream")
   
   # Join
   joined_df = stream_df.join(static_df, "join_key")
   ```
   - Stream joined with static DataFrame
   - Static data can be broadcast for efficiency
   - Static data is loaded once per trigger

2. **Stream-Stream Join:**
   ```python
   # Two streaming sources
   stream1 = spark.readStream.format("delta").load("/data/stream1")
   stream2 = spark.readStream.format("delta").load("/data/stream2")
   
   # Join with watermarks
   joined = stream1.withWatermark("time1", "10 minutes") \
                   .join(
                     stream2.withWatermark("time2", "5 minutes"),
                     expr("join_key AND time1 >= time2 - interval 5 minutes AND time1 <= time2 + interval 5 minutes"),
                     "inner"
                   )
   ```
   - Joins two streams
   - Requires watermarks and join conditions on event time
   - More complex state management

**State Management:**

Stream joins maintain state information between batches:
- State size depends on watermark configuration
- Improper watermarks can lead to memory issues
- Checkpoint location stores state between restarts

**Optimizing Stream-Static Joins:**

1. **Broadcast Join:**
   ```python
   # Broadcast the static DataFrame
   joined_df = stream_df.join(F.broadcast(static_df), "join_key")
   ```
   - Efficient for small static tables
   - Reduces shuffle operations

2. **State Store Optimization:**
   ```python
   # Configure state store
   spark.conf.set("spark.sql.streaming.stateStore.providerClass", 
                 "org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.state.RocksDBStateStoreProvider")
   ```
   - RocksDB state store for large state
   - More efficient than default in-memory store

3. **Watermark Tuning:**
   ```python
   # Tight watermark for state cleanup
   df = df.withWatermark("event_time", "30 minutes")
   ```
   - Balance between late data and state size

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Implementing and optimizing stream-static joins
- Managing state in streaming applications
- Tuning for performance and reliability

### 7. Change Data Feed (CDF) and Incremental Data Processing

Change Data Feed (CDF) captures row-level changes in Delta tables, enabling incremental processing patterns.

**Change Data Feed Overview:**

```sql
-- Enable CDF for a table
ALTER TABLE my_table SET TBLPROPERTIES (delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true)

-- Create a new table with CDF enabled
CREATE TABLE my_table (id INT, name STRING)
TBLPROPERTIES (delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true)
```

- Tracks insert, update, and delete operations
- Maintains versioned history of changes
- Enables efficient incremental processing

**Reading Change Data:**

```python
# Read changes since version 10
changes = spark.read.format("delta") \
               .option("readChangeData", "true") \
               .option("startingVersion", 10) \
               .table("my_table")
```

Each CDF record contains:
- The modified data
- Operation type (insert, update, delete)
- Commit version and timestamp

**CDC vs. CDF:**
- **CDC (Change Data Capture):** Source system feature that captures changes
- **CDF (Change Data Feed):** Delta Lake feature that exposes changes

**APPLY CHANGES INTO:**

The `APPLY CHANGES INTO` operation simplifies CDC/CDF processing:

```sql
-- Apply changes from source to target
APPLY CHANGES INTO target_table
FROM source_cdc_table
KEYS (id)
SEQUENCE BY sequence_num
```

- Automatically handles inserts, updates, deletes
- Simplifies complex merge operations
- Requires unique key and sequence columns

**Implementing CDC Pipeline:**

```python
# Read CDC data
cdc_df = spark.readStream.format("delta") \
                         .option("readChangeData", "true") \
                         .load("/data/source")

# Process by operation type
def process_cdc_batch(batch_df, batch_id):
    # Extract operation types
    inserts = batch_df.filter("_change_type = 'insert'").drop("_change_type")
    updates = batch_df.filter("_change_type = 'update'").drop("_change_type")
    deletes = batch_df.filter("_change_type = 'delete'").drop("_change_type")
    
    # Apply to target table
    if not inserts.isEmpty():
        inserts.write.format("delta").mode("append").save("/data/target")
    
    if not updates.isEmpty() or not deletes.isEmpty():
        deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "/data/target")
        
        # Handle updates
        if not updates.isEmpty():
            deltaTable.alias("target").merge(
                updates.alias("updates"),
                "target.id = updates.id"
            ).whenMatched().updateAll().execute()
        
        # Handle deletes
        if not deletes.isEmpty():
            deltaTable.alias("target").merge(
                deletes.alias("deletes"),
                "target.id = deletes.id"
            ).whenMatched().delete().execute()

# Apply foreachBatch function
query = cdc_df.writeStream \
             .foreachBatch(process_cdc_batch) \
             .option("checkpointLocation", "/checkpoints/cdc") \
             .start()
```

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Enabling and using Change Data Feed
- Implementing incremental processing with CDF
- Understanding CDF vs. CDC concepts

   a) filter()
   b) select()
   c) groupBy()
   d) withColumn()

2. What is the primary difference between repartition() and coalesce()?
   a) repartition() can only increase partitions, coalesce() can only decrease them
   b) repartition() performs a full shuffle, coalesce() minimizes shuffling

   c) Partition changes only
   d) Metadata changes only

7. Which operation is used to efficiently propagate changes from a source CDC table to a target Delta table?
   a) INSERT OVERWRITE
   b) MERGE INTO
   c) APPLY CHANGES INTO
   d) UPDATE SET

8. What is the main advantage of using foreachBatch in Structured Streaming over standard output sinks?
   a) It provides higher throughput
   b) It allows you to apply different operations to each batch
   c) It guarantees exactly-once processing
   d) It eliminates the need for checkpointing

**Answers and Explanations:**

1. c) groupBy() - This operation requires data with the same keys to be on the same partition, which necessitates a shuffle operation.

2. b) repartition() performs a full shuffle, coalesce() minimizes shuffling - repartition() redistributes data evenly through a full shuffle, while coalesce() combines existing partitions with minimal data movement.

3. c) Complete - Complete output mode writes the entire result table each time, which requires an aggregation to maintain the complete state.

4. b) To handle late-arriving data and manage state cleanup - Watermarking defines how late data can arrive and allows the system to clean up state for records older than the watermark.

5. b) Broadcast join - Broadcasting a small static DataFrame to all executors eliminates the need for shuffling in the streaming job.

6. b) Row-level changes (inserts, updates, deletes) - CDF tracks all row-level modifications to the table, including the operation type and the changed data.

7. c) APPLY CHANGES INTO - This operation is specifically designed to handle CDC data, automatically applying inserts, updates, and deletes based on the source data.

8. b) It allows you to apply different operations to each batch - foreachBatch gives you complete control over how each micro-batch is processed, enabling complex logic that isn't possible with standard sinks.

## Data Modeling & Security

### 1. Lakehouse Medallion Architecture

The medallion architecture is a design pattern that organizes data in the Lakehouse into three distinct layers, each representing a different level of data refinement.

**Core Layers of the Medallion Architecture:**

1. **Bronze Layer (Raw)**
   - Raw data ingested from source systems
   - Preserves original data format and content
   - Minimal or no transformations
   - Serves as historical archive
   - Example: JSON files from API, CSV exports, database dumps

2. **Silver Layer (Cleansed)**
   - Validated and cleansed data
   - Standardized schema and data types
   - Duplicate records removed
   - Basic quality rules applied
   - Typically in Delta format with optimizations
   - Example: Parsed JSON, validated timestamps, removed duplicates

3. **Gold Layer (Business)**
   - Aggregated and enriched for specific use cases
   - Optimized for query performance
   - Business metrics and KPIs
   - Often dimensional models or wide tables
   - Serves as source for reporting and ML
   - Example: Customer 360 view, sales aggregations by region

**Data Flow Through the Medallion Architecture:**

```
Source Systems → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Consumption
```

**Implementation Considerations:**

- **Schema Evolution**: Bronze preserves all fields for future use
- **Processing Patterns**: Batch vs. streaming at different layers
- **Retention Policies**: Different for each layer (longer for bronze)
- **Access Patterns**: More restricted for bronze, broader for gold
- **Optimization**: Increases from bronze to gold

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Purpose and characteristics of each layer
- How data flows through the architecture
- Implementation strategies for each layer

### 2. Data Quality Enforcement

Data quality is essential for reliable analytics and decision-making. Delta Lake provides several mechanisms for enforcing data quality.

**Data Quality Enforcement Techniques:**

1. **Schema Enforcement**:
   - Built into Delta Lake
   - Ensures data conforms to expected structure
   - Prevents schema drift

   ```python
   # Schema enforcement in action
   from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType

   schema = StructType([
       StructField("id", StringType(), False),
       StructField("name", StringType(), True),
       StructField("age", IntegerType(), True)
   ])

   # Write with schema
   df.write.format("delta").schema(schema).save("/path/to/table")

   # Attempt to write incompatible data will fail
   incompatible_df.write.format("delta").mode("append").save("/path/to/table")
   ```

2. **Constraints**:
   - Business rules applied to data
   - Enforced during write operations

   ```sql
   -- Add NOT NULL constraint
   ALTER TABLE customer_data ADD CONSTRAINT valid_id CHECK (id IS NOT NULL);

   -- Add uniqueness constraint
   ALTER TABLE customer_data ADD CONSTRAINT unique_id CHECK (id IS NOT NULL AND id <> '');

   -- Add value range constraint
   ALTER TABLE customer_data ADD CONSTRAINT valid_age CHECK (age > 0 AND age < 120);
   ```

3. **Quality Expectations in Delta Live Tables**:

   ```python
   # Bronze layer with minimal expectations
   @dlt.table
   def bronze_customer_data():
       return spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles") \
           .option("cloudFiles.format", "json") \
           .load("/data/raw/customers")

   # Silver layer with quality constraints
   @dlt.table(
       constraint="valid_customer_record",
       expect_or_drop="id IS NOT NULL AND age > 0"
   )
   def silver_customer_data():
       return dlt.read("bronze_customer_data") \
           .dropDuplicates(["id"]) \
           .withColumn("processed_timestamp", current_timestamp())
   ```

4. **Enforcement Modes**:

   ```python
   # Fail the entire batch if any record violates constraints
   @dlt.table(
       constraint="valid_metric",
       expect_or_fail="metric_value > 0"
   )
   
   # Drop records that violate constraints
   @dlt.table(
       constraint="valid_customer",
       expect_or_drop="id IS NOT NULL AND age > 0"
   )
   
   # Quarantine records that violate constraints
   @dlt.table
   def silver_good_records():
       return dlt.read("bronze_table").where("id IS NOT NULL")
   
   @dlt.table
   def silver_bad_records():
       return dlt.read("bronze_table").where("id IS NULL")
   ```

**Implementing a Data Quality Framework:**

1. **Define Quality Dimensions**:
   - Completeness: Are all expected values present?
   - Accuracy: Are values correct?
   - Consistency: Are related values consistent?
   - Uniqueness: Are unique values truly unique?
   - Timeliness: Is data current?

2. **Implement Testing Layers**:
   - Bronze: Format validation, completeness checks
   - Silver: Business rule validation, referential integrity
   - Gold: Aggregation consistency, trend validation

3. **Monitor Quality Metrics**:
   - Track failure rates over time
   - Create quality dashboards
   - Implement alerts for quality degradation

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Different techniques for enforcing data quality
- How to implement quality rules at each layer
- Handling quality violations appropriately

---

### 3. Implementing Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs)

Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) are techniques for handling historical changes in dimensional data. Delta Lake provides powerful capabilities for implementing various SCD types.

**SCD Type 0: Retain Original**

- Dimension attributes never change
- Historical accuracy is not maintained
- Example: Birth date, original customer acquisition date

```python
# Simple overwrite with only new records (no updates to existing)
new_customers.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable("customers_type0")
```

**SCD Type 1: Overwrite**

- Replaces old values with new values
- No history is maintained
- Example: Correcting errors, updating phone numbers

```python
# Using MERGE to implement Type 1 SCD
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

deltaTable = DeltaTable.forName(spark, "customers_type1")

# Merge operation
deltaTable.alias("target").merge(
    source=updates_df.alias("updates"),
    condition="target.customer_id = updates.customer_id"
).whenMatched().updateAll().execute()
```

**SCD Type 2: Add New Row**

- Maintains complete history
- Creates new records for changes
- Tracks current vs. historical records
- Example: Customer address changes, organizational changes

```python
# Read current dimension table
dim_customer = spark.read.format("delta").table("dim_customer")

# Identify changed records
# 1. Join new data with current dimension
# 2. Filter for changes in tracked columns
changes = new_data.alias("new") \
    .join(dim_customer.alias("current"), 
          "customer_id", 
          "left_outer") \
    .where("current.customer_id IS NULL OR " + 
           "new.name <> current.name OR " + 
           "new.address <> current.address") \
    .select("new.*")

# Expire current records
if not changes.isEmpty():
    deltaTable = DeltaTable.forName(spark, "dim_customer")
    
    # Match records to be updated
    matched_records = deltaTable.alias("dim") \
        .merge(
            changes.alias("updates"),
            "dim.customer_id = updates.customer_id AND dim.is_current = true"
        )
    
    # Update matched records (expire them)
    matched_records.whenMatched().updateExpr({
        "is_current": "false",
        "end_date": "current_date()",
        "updated_timestamp": "current_timestamp()"
    })
    
    # Insert new versions
    .whenNotMatched().insertExpr({
        "customer_id": "updates.customer_id",
        "name": "updates.name",
        "address": "updates.address",
        "is_current": "true",
        "start_date": "current_date()",
        "end_date": "null",
        "updated_timestamp": "current_timestamp()"
    }).execute()
```

**SCD Type 3: Add New Columns**

- Maintains limited history (typically current and previous)
- Adds columns for previous values
- Example: Previous address, former name

```python
# Read current dimension
dim_product = spark.read.format("delta").table("dim_product")

# Identify changes
changes = new_data.alias("new") \
    .join(dim_product.alias("current"), 
          "product_id", 
          "inner") \
    .where("new.category <> current.category") \
    .select("new.*", "current.category AS previous_category")

# Apply Type 3 updates
if not changes.isEmpty():
    deltaTable = DeltaTable.forName(spark, "dim_product")
    
    deltaTable.alias("dim").merge(
        changes.alias("updates"),
        "dim.product_id = updates.product_id"
    ).whenMatched().updateExpr({
        "previous_category": "dim.category",
        "category": "updates.category",
        "updated_timestamp": "current_timestamp()"
    }).execute()
```

**SCD Type 6: Hybrid Approach (Combined Type 1 + 2 + 3)**

- Maintains current and historical records (Type 2)
- Updates current version attributes for Type 1 fields
- Maintains versioning for Type 2 fields
- Example: Customer dimension with both fixed and tracked attributes

```python
# Complex implementation that combines Type 1, 2, and 3 approaches
# Not showing full code due to complexity, but key concepts include:
# 1. Identifying which attributes are Type 1 vs. Type 2
# 2. Maintaining version numbers for records
# 3. Using both effective dates and is_current flags
# 4. Selective updating based on attribute type
```

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Understanding different SCD types and their use cases
- Implementing SCDs using Delta Lake operations
- Managing current vs. historical records

### 4. Hands-on: Building a Medallion Architecture Pipeline

Let's walk through implementing a complete medallion architecture pipeline using Delta Lake and Delta Live Tables.

**Scenario: Customer Order Processing Pipeline**

We'll build a pipeline that processes customer order data through the bronze, silver, and gold layers.

**1. Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion**

```python
# Using Delta Live Tables
@dlt.table(
    name="bronze_orders",
    comment="Raw order data from JSON files"
)
def bronze_orders():
    return (
        spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles")
        .option("cloudFiles.format", "json")
        .option("cloudFiles.schemaLocation", "/tmp/schema/orders")
        .load("/data/raw/orders")
    )

@dlt.table(
    name="bronze_customers",
    comment="Raw customer data from CSV files"
)
def bronze_customers():
    return (
        spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles")
        .option("cloudFiles.format", "csv")
        .option("cloudFiles.schemaLocation", "/tmp/schema/customers")
        .option("header", "true")
        .load("/data/raw/customers")
    )
```

**2. Silver Layer: Cleansed and Validated Data**

```python
@dlt.table(
    name="silver_customers",
    comment="Cleansed customer records",
    constraint="valid_customer_id",
    expect_or_drop="customer_id IS NOT NULL"
)
def silver_customers():
    return (
        dlt.read("bronze_customers")
        .dropDuplicates(["customer_id"])
        .withColumn("processed_date", current_date())
        .withColumn("valid_email", 
                   F.expr("email RLIKE '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$'"))
    )

@dlt.table(
    name="silver_orders",
    comment="Cleansed order records with validated references",
    constraint="valid_order", 
    expect_or_drop="order_id IS NOT NULL AND customer_id IS NOT NULL AND amount > 0"
)
def silver_orders():
    # Join with customers to validate references
    customers = dlt.read("silver_customers").select("customer_id").distinct()
    
    return (
        dlt.read("bronze_orders")
        .dropDuplicates(["order_id"])
        .withColumn("order_date", F.to_date(F.col("order_timestamp")))
        .withColumn("processed_date", current_date())
        .join(customers, "customer_id", "left_semi")  # Only keep orders with valid customers
    )
```

**3. Gold Layer: Business-Ready Aggregations**

```python
@dlt.table(
    name="gold_customer_orders",
    comment="Customer order summaries by day"
)
def gold_customer_orders():
    return (
        dlt.read("silver_orders")
        .groupBy("customer_id", "order_date")
        .agg(
            F.count("order_id").alias("order_count"),
            F.sum("amount").alias("total_amount"),
            F.avg("amount").alias("avg_order_value"),
            F.max("amount").alias("largest_order")
        )
    )

@dlt.table(
    name="gold_daily_sales",
    comment="Daily sales aggregations"
)
def gold_daily_sales():
    return (
        dlt.read("silver_orders")
        .groupBy("order_date")
        .agg(
            F.count("order_id").alias("total_orders"),
            F.sum("amount").alias("total_sales"),
            F.countDistinct("customer_id").alias("unique_customers")
        )
    )
```

**4. Pipeline Configuration**

```json

### 6. Dynamic Views for Data Masking

Dynamic views provide a powerful mechanism for implementing data masking and access control in Databricks.

**Dynamic Views Concept:**

- SQL views with custom logic based on user attributes
- Enable row and column-level security
- Create different "views" of the same data for different users
- Implement data masking for sensitive fields

**Creating a Dynamic View for Column Masking:**

```sql
-- Create a view that masks PII based on user group
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW masked_customer_data AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  -- Full name only visible to admins
  CASE WHEN is_member('admins') THEN full_name
       ELSE 'REDACTED'
  END AS full_name,
  -- Last 4 digits of SSN for finance team, nothing for others
  CASE WHEN is_member('admins') THEN ssn
       WHEN is_member('finance') THEN CONCAT('XXX-XX-', RIGHT(ssn, 4))
       ELSE 'XXX-XX-XXXX'
  END AS ssn,
  -- Email domain only for most users
  CASE WHEN is_member('admins') THEN email
       WHEN is_member('marketing') THEN email
       ELSE CONCAT('user@', SPLIT(email, '@')[1])
  END AS email,
  -- Only show birth year for most users
  CASE WHEN is_member('admins') THEN date_of_birth
       ELSE CONCAT(YEAR(date_of_birth), '-01-01')
  END AS date_of_birth,
  -- Non-sensitive fields visible to all
  address_city,
  address_state,
  customer_status
FROM customers
```

**Row-Level Security with Dynamic Views:**

```sql
-- Create a view with row-level filtering based on region access
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW regional_sales AS
SELECT *
FROM sales
WHERE
  -- Admins see all regions
  is_member('admins') OR
  -- Regional managers see only their region
  (is_member('region_na') AND region = 'North America') OR
  (is_member('region_emea') AND region = 'EMEA') OR
  (is_member('region_apac') AND region = 'APAC')
```

**Combining Row and Column Security:**

```sql
-- View that implements both row and column level security
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW secured_employee_data AS
SELECT
  employee_id,
  -- Column masking
  CASE WHEN is_member('hr') OR is_member('admins') THEN salary
       ELSE NULL
  END AS salary,
  CASE WHEN is_member('hr') OR is_member('admins') THEN personal_email
       ELSE work_email
  END AS contact_email,
  department,
  title,
  hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE
  -- Row filtering
  is_member('admins') OR
  -- Managers see their department
  (is_member('managers') AND department IN 
    (SELECT department FROM employee_managers WHERE manager_id = current_user())) OR
  -- Employees see only themselves
  (is_member('employees') AND employee_id IN 
    (SELECT employee_id FROM employees WHERE email = current_user()))
```

**Best Practices for Dynamic Views:**

1. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize view definitions for performance
   - Use appropriate indexing on filtered columns
   - Cache frequently accessed views when possible

2. **Maintenance Strategy**
   - Centralize view definitions
   - Document masking rules
   - Regular security audits of views

3. **Access Control**
   - Grant SELECT on views instead of base tables
   - Restrict direct table access
   - Audit view usage

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Implementing column-level security with dynamic views
- Implementing row-level security with dynamic views
- Performance considerations for dynamic views

### 7. Row and Column-Level Security

Beyond dynamic views, Databricks provides additional mechanisms for implementing row and column-level security.

**Unity Catalog Column-Level Security:**

Unity Catalog allows direct control over column-level access:

```sql
-- Grant access to specific columns
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE customers(customer_id, name, city) TO role_analyst;

-- Deny access to sensitive columns
DENY SELECT ON TABLE customers(credit_card, ssn) TO role_analyst;
```

**Row-Level Security with Row Filters:**

```sql
-- Create a row filter
CREATE ROW FILTER region_filter ON sales AS
  CASE WHEN is_member('admins') THEN TRUE
       WHEN is_member('na_sales') AND region = 'North America' THEN TRUE
       WHEN is_member('emea_sales') AND region = 'EMEA' THEN TRUE
       ELSE FALSE
  END;

-- Apply the row filter to a role
ALTER TABLE sales ADD ROW FILTER region_filter TO role_regional_analyst;
```

**Column-Level Security with Column Masks:**

```sql
-- Create a column mask for PII
CREATE MASK pii_mask ON TABLE customers COLUMN email AS
  CASE WHEN is_member('admins') THEN email
       WHEN is_member('marketing') THEN email
       ELSE CONCAT('user@', SPLIT(email, '@')[1])
  END;

-- Apply the mask to a role
ALTER TABLE customers ALTER COLUMN email SET MASK pii_mask TO role_analyst;
```

**Data Access Patterns:**

Different access patterns require different security approaches:

1. **Shared Access Pattern**
   - Multiple teams access same physical data
   - Use dynamic views or row/column controls
   - Minimize data duplication

2. **Siloed Access Pattern**
   - Each team has their own copy of data
   - Use table/database level permissions
   - Higher storage costs but simpler management

3. **Hybrid Access Pattern**
   - Sensitive data is siloed
   - Common data is shared
   - Use combination of approaches

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Unity Catalog security features
- Row filters and column masks
- Choosing appropriate access patterns

**Answers and Explanations:**

1. b) Silver layer - The silver layer contains data that has been cleansed, validated, and standardized, but has not yet been aggregated or transformed for specific business use cases (which happens in the gold layer).

2. c) SCD Type 2 - Type 2 SCDs create new records when dimension attributes change, typically using start and end dates or current/historical flags to track the complete history.

3. b) expect_or_fail - The expect_or_fail constraint causes the entire pipeline to fail if any record violates the specified condition, which is useful for critical data quality checks.

4. d) Data Transformation - The four main areas of data governance are Data Security, Data Governance (metadata management), Compliance, and Privacy. Data Transformation is part of data processing, not governance.

5. c) To implement row and column-level security based on user attributes - Dynamic views in Databricks are primarily used to implement security controls that adjust what data is visible based on who is viewing it.

6. a) Catalog → Schema → Table - In Unity Catalog, the hierarchy is Catalog at the top, containing Schemas (also called Databases), which contain Tables and other objects.

7. c) Creating column masks in Unity Catalog - Column masks in Unity Catalog provide the most efficient and maintainable way to implement column-level security across multiple users and roles.

8. c) SCD Type 2 - SCD Type 2 is ideal for tracking customer address changes over time while maintaining the complete history, which is important for historical analysis and compliance.

## Monitoring, Testing & Deployment

### 1. Spark UI Performance Analysis

The Spark UI is the primary tool for analyzing and troubleshooting Spark application performance. Understanding how to interpret the information it provides is crucial for optimizing data pipelines.

**Accessing Spark UI in Databricks:**

The Spark UI is available in multiple ways:
- Through the Databricks UI via the cluster details page
- Directly via the Spark UI tab in a notebook
- Through the History Server for completed applications

**Key Components of the Spark UI:**

**Jobs Tab:**
The Jobs tab shows high-level execution information for each job:
- Job submission time and duration
- Number of stages and tasks
- Status (running, succeeded, failed)
- Action that triggered the job (e.g., collect(), count(), save())

When analyzing the Jobs tab, look for:
- Long-running jobs that might need optimization
- Failed jobs and their error messages
- Skew in stage durations within a job

**Stages Tab:**
The Stages tab provides deeper insights into each stage:
- Task distribution and skew
- Executor utilization
- Data read/write metrics
- Shuffle metrics

Critical metrics to examine:
- **Duration Distribution:** Identifies skewed tasks
- **Shuffle Read/Write:** High values indicate potential bottlenecks
- **Spill Metrics:** Memory pressure indicators
- **Input/Output Metrics:** Data volume processed

**Executors Tab:**
The Executors tab shows resource utilization across the cluster:
- Memory usage (storage and execution)
- Disk usage
- Task metrics per executor
- GC (Garbage Collection) time

Key indicators of problems:
- High GC time relative to execution time
- Uneven task distribution
- Excessive memory spills
- Executor failures

**Storage Tab:**
The Storage tab displays information about cached data:
- RDD and DataFrame caching
- Memory vs. disk storage
- Cache hit/miss ratios

**Environment Tab:**
Contains configuration settings for the Spark application:
- Spark properties
- JVM properties
- System properties
- Classpath entries

**SQL Tab:**
For Spark SQL and DataFrame operations:
- Query execution plans
- SQL metrics
- Active sessions

**Common Performance Issues and Indicators:**

**1. Data Skew:**

### 2. Monitoring Streaming Jobs and SLAs

Streaming jobs require continuous monitoring to ensure they meet performance SLAs and operate reliably.

**Key Structured Streaming Metrics:**

**Processing Rate Metrics:**
- **Input Rate:** Records processed per second
- **Processing Rate:** Rate at which records are processed
- **Batch Duration:** Time to process each micro-batch

**Latency Metrics:**
- **End-to-End Latency:** Time from data arrival to processing completion
- **Trigger Processing Time:** Time spent processing each trigger
- **Scheduling Delay:** Time between triggers

**Operational Metrics:**

- **Watermark Delay:** Current watermark position

**Monitoring Streaming Jobs in Databricks:**

**1. Structured Streaming UI:**
Available through the Spark UI, provides:
- Input and processing rates over time
- Batch processing times
- Operation durations within each batch

**2. Streaming Query Metrics:**
```python
# Get active streaming queries
active_streams = spark.streams.active

# For each active stream
for stream in active_streams:
    # Get recent progress metrics
    progress = stream.recentProgress
    
    # Get current status
    status = stream.status
    
    # Get specific metrics
    latest = progress[-1] if progress else None
    if latest:
        print(f"Query: {stream.name}")
        print(f"Input rate: {latest['inputRowsPerSecond']}")
        print(f"Processing rate: {latest['processedRowsPerSecond']}")
        print(f"Batch duration: {latest['batchDuration']}")
```

**3. Metrics Collection for Long-Term Analysis:**
```python
# Function to log streaming metrics to Delta table
def log_streaming_metrics(batch_df, batch_id):
    # Get all active streams
    active_streams = spark.streams.active
    
    # Collect metrics
    metrics = []
    for stream in active_streams:
        progress = stream.lastProgress
        if progress:
            metrics.append({
                "timestamp": datetime.now(),
                "query_id": stream.id.toString(),
                "query_name": stream.name,
                "input_rows_per_second": progress.get("inputRowsPerSecond", 0),
                "processed_rows_per_second": progress.get("processedRowsPerSecond", 0),
                "batch_duration_ms": progress.get("batchDuration", 0),
                "num_input_rows": progress.get("numInputRows", 0),
                "batch_id": batch_id
            })
    
    # Create DataFrame from metrics and write to Delta table
    if metrics:
        metrics_df = spark.createDataFrame(metrics)
        metrics_df.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable("streaming_metrics")

# Apply to streaming query
query = df.writeStream \
    .foreachBatch(log_streaming_metrics) \
    .outputMode("update") \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/path/to/checkpoint") \
    .start()
```

**SLA Monitoring and Alerting:**

**1. Define SLA Metrics:**
- Throughput SLAs: Minimum processing rate
- Latency SLAs: Maximum end-to-end delay
- Availability SLAs: Uptime percentage
- Cost SLAs: Maximum resources used

**2. Implement Monitoring Dashboards:**
```python
# Create dashboard for streaming metrics
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, window

# Read metrics table
metrics = spark.read.table("streaming_metrics")

# Aggregations for dashboard
sla_metrics = metrics.groupBy(window("timestamp", "1 hour")) \
    .agg(
        min("processed_rows_per_second").alias("min_rate"),
        max("batch_duration_ms").alias("max_batch_duration"),
        avg("input_rows_per_second").alias("avg_input_rate")
    ) \
    .withColumn("sla_throughput_met", col("min_rate") > 1000) \
    .withColumn("sla_latency_met", col("max_batch_duration") < 60000)

# Write to dashboard table
sla_metrics.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("streaming_sla_dashboard")
```

**3. Implement Alerting:**
```python
# Function to check SLAs and trigger alerts
def check_slas(batch_df, batch_id):
    # Get latest metrics
    active_streams = spark.streams.active
    for stream in active_streams:
        progress = stream.lastProgress
        if progress:
            # Check throughput SLA
            input_rate = progress.get("inputRowsPerSecond", 0)
            processed_rate = progress.get("processedRowsPerSecond", 0)
            if processed_rate < 1000:  # Example SLA threshold
                # Trigger throughput alert
                send_alert(f"Throughput SLA violated: {processed_rate} rows/sec")
            
            # Check latency SLA
            batch_duration = progress.get("batchDuration", 0)
            if batch_duration > 60000:  # Example SLA threshold (60 seconds)
                # Trigger latency alert
                send_alert(f"Latency SLA violated: {batch_duration} ms")

# Helper function to send alerts
def send_alert(message):
    # Integration with alerting system (email, Slack, etc.)
    print(f"ALERT: {message}")
    # In production, integrate with actual alerting systems
```

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Critical metrics for monitoring streaming jobs
- Methods for collecting and analyzing streaming metrics
- Implementing SLA monitoring and alerting

### 3. Ganglia UI and Cluster UI Interpretation

Beyond the Spark UI, Databricks provides additional interfaces for monitoring cluster resources and overall performance.

**Ganglia UI:**

Ganglia is a distributed monitoring system for clusters that collects and visualizes key system metrics:

**Cluster-Level Metrics:**
- CPU utilization across the cluster
- Memory usage patterns
- Network I/O
- Disk I/O

**Node-Level Metrics:**
- Per-node CPU usage
- Memory consumption
- Swap usage
- Network traffic

**Interpreting Ganglia Metrics:**

**1. CPU Metrics:**
- High overall CPU usage: May indicate compute-bound workload
- Uneven CPU usage: Potential data skew or improper resource allocation
- High CPU iowait: I/O bottlenecks

**2. Memory Metrics:**
- Increasing memory usage: Potential memory leak or insufficient resources
- High swap usage: Memory pressure, need to increase executor memory
- Memory fluctuations: Inefficient caching or garbage collection issues

**3. Network Metrics:**
- High network traffic: Excessive shuffling or data movement
- Network spikes: Broadcast operations or large data transfers
- Network bottlenecks: May require cluster network optimization

**4. Disk Metrics:**
- High disk I/O: Spilling to disk, inefficient caching
- Disk space utilization: Storage constraints
- Disk latency: Storage performance issues

**Databricks Cluster UI:**

The Databricks Cluster UI provides information specific to the Databricks environment:

**Cluster Configuration:**
- Node types and counts
- Databricks Runtime version
- Autoscaling settings
- Cluster policies

**Driver and Executor Logs:**
- Standard output/error logs
- Spark application logs
- Initialization script logs
- Cluster event logs

**Cluster Metrics:**
- Cluster load
- Worker status
- Autoscaling events
- Termination reasons

**Common Issues and Signs:**

**1. Resource Underutilization:**
- Symptoms: Low CPU/memory usage across cluster
- Solution: Rightsize cluster, reduce worker count, use node types with fewer resources

**2. Resource Overutilization:**
- Symptoms: Consistently high CPU/memory, frequent task failures
- Solution: Increase cluster size, enable autoscaling, use larger node types

**3. Imbalanced Cluster:**
- Symptoms: Some nodes heavily loaded, others idle
- Solution: Review partitioning strategy, check for data skew

**4. Unstable Cluster:**
- Symptoms: Frequent node failures, job failures
- Solution: Check initialization scripts, review worker logs, validate dependencies

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Differentiating between Spark UI, Ganglia UI, and Cluster UI
- Interpreting system-level metrics in Ganglia
- Correlating application behavior with system metrics

### 4. Hands-on: Debugging Performance Issues

Let's walk through a practical approach to identifying and solving common performance issues in Databricks.

**Scenario: Investigating a Slow-Running ETL Pipeline**

You've received alerts that an important ETL pipeline is taking significantly longer than usual. Let's go through a systematic approach to debug and optimize it.

**Step 1: Identify Bottlenecks in Spark UI**

First, examine the Jobs tab to find the slowest jobs:
1. Look for jobs with long duration
2. Check if the job duration has increased over time
3. Identify stages within those jobs that are taking the most time

```
Sample Job Analysis:
- Job 4: 45 minutes (normally takes 10 minutes)
  - Stage 10: 40 minutes
  - Stage 11: 5 minutes
```

**Step 2: Analyze Slow Stages**

For the slowest stage (Stage 10), examine:
1. Task distribution and skew
2. Shuffle read/write metrics
3. Executor utilization

```
Stage 10 Analysis:
- 1000 total tasks
- Task duration: min=5s, median=20s, max=35min
- Significant task skew detected
- Large shuffle write: 200GB
```

**Step 3: Check Ganglia for Resource Utilization**

Look at Ganglia metrics during the slow period:
1. CPU usage pattern
2. Memory utilization
3. Disk I/O activity
4. Network traffic

```
Ganglia Findings:
- Memory utilization near maximum
- High disk I/O on several nodes
- GC activity increased
- Network traffic normal
```

**Step 4: Examine Query Plan for Inefficiencies**

For SQL operations, analyze the query plan:
1. Check join strategies (broadcast vs. sort-merge)
2. Look for cartesian products or expensive operations
3. Verify partition pruning is happening

```python
# Examine the query plan
slow_query.explain(True)

# Sample output showing inefficient join:
# == Physical Plan ==
# *(5) SortMergeJoin [large_key], [large_key]
# :- *(2) Sort [large_key ASC], false, 0
# :  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(large_key, 200)
# :     +- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(large_key))
# :        +- Scan Delta [large_table]
# +- *(4) Sort [large_key ASC], false, 0
#    +- Exchange hashpartitioning(large_key, 200)
#       +- *(3) Filter (isnotnull(large_key))
#          +- Scan Delta [other_large_table]
```

**Step 5: Implement Targeted Optimizations**

Based on the analysis, implement specific optimizations:

**For Data Skew:**
```python
# Add salting to skewed key
from pyspark.sql.functions import rand, col

# Instead of joining directly on skewed_key
df = df.withColumn("salted_key", concat(col("skewed_key"), (rand() * 10).cast("int").cast("string")))

# Join on salted key
result = df.join(other_df.withColumn("salted_key", 
                                     explode(array([lit(i) for i in range(10)]))
                                     .withColumn("salted_key", 
                                                concat(col("skewed_key"), col("salted_key").cast("string")))), 
                 "salted_key")
```

**For Inefficient Joins:**
```python
# Use broadcast join for small tables
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast

# Before: Regular join causing shuffle
result = large_df.join(small_df, "key")

# After: Broadcast the small table
result = large_df.join(broadcast(small_df), "key")
```

**For Memory Pressure:**
```python
# Repartition to better distribute data
df = df.repartition(500, "key")

# Control caching strategy
df.cache()  # Default caching
# or
df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)  # Spill to disk if needed
```

**For Inefficient I/O:**
```python
# Add appropriate file size optimization 
df.write.option("maxRecordsPerFile", 1000000).save("/path")

# Add partitioning for query efficiency
df.write.partitionBy("date", "region").save("/path")
```

**Step 6: Monitor Improvements**

After implementing optimizations:
1. Re-run the job and compare metrics
2. Validate performance improvements
3. Document findings and solutions for future reference

**Key Debugging Approaches:**

1. **Systematic Investigation:**
   - Start broad, then focus on specific issues
   - Use multiple monitoring tools for complete picture
   - Follow the data path to identify bottlenecks

2. **Data Flow Analysis:**
   - Understand data volumes at each stage
   - Identify where data expands or contracts
   - Look for unnecessary shuffles or redundant processing

3. **Resource Utilization Review:**
   - Match resource allocation to workload requirements
   - Identify imbalances in resource utilization
   - Consider cost implications of optimizations

**Key Exam Concepts:**
- Systematic approach to performance debugging
- Identifying specific optimization techniques for different issues
- Correlating symptoms with root causes

### 5. Databricks Jobs Configuration and Dependencies

Databricks Jobs provide a way to schedule, monitor, and manage production workloads reliably.

**Job Components:**

**1. Tasks:**
- Basic unit of execution in a job
- Can be notebooks, JARs, wheels, or Delta Live Tables pipelines
- Have individual configuration and retry policies

**2. Job Configuration:**
- Schedule settings
- Cluster configuration
- Parameters and environment variables
- Notification settings

**3. Workflows:**
- Collection of dependent tasks
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of task dependencies
- Sequential or parallel execution paths

**Creating Multi-Task Jobs:**

**Simple Job with Sequential Tasks:**
```json
{
  "name": "Customer Data Processing",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_key": "ingest_data",
      "notebook_task": {
        "notebook_path": "/Shared/ETL/ingest_customer_data",

### 6. Databricks CLI and REST API Implementation

The Databricks CLI and REST API provide programmatic ways to interact with Databricks resources, enabling automation and integration with external systems.

**Databricks CLI:**

**Installation and Configuration:**
```bash
# Install Databricks CLI
pip install databricks-cli

# Configure authentication
databricks configure --token
# Enter host (e.g., https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com)
# Enter token

# Verify configuration
databricks workspace ls
```

**Working with Workspace Assets:**
```bash
# List workspace contents
databricks workspace ls /Shared

# Export notebook
databricks workspace export /Shared/MyNotebook -f JUPYTER -o my_notebook.ipynb

# Import notebook
databricks workspace import my_notebook.ipynb /Shared/ImportedNotebook -l PYTHON -f JUPYTER

# Create directory
databricks workspace mkdirs /Shared/NewDirectory
```

**Managing Jobs:**
```bash
# List jobs
databricks jobs list

# Get job details
databricks jobs get --job-id 123

# Run a job
databricks jobs run-now --job-id 123

# Create a job from JSON definition
databricks jobs create --json @job_definition.json
```

**Cluster Management:**
```bash
# List clusters
databricks clusters list

# Start/stop cluster
databricks clusters start --cluster-id 0923-164819-h73vpgf0
databricks clusters terminate --cluster-id 0923-164819-h73vpgf0

# Create a cluster
databricks clusters create --json @cluster_config.json
```

**DBFS Operations:**
```bash
# List files
databricks fs ls dbfs:/data/

# Copy files to DBFS
databricks fs cp local_file.csv dbfs:/data/

# Move files within DBFS
databricks fs mv dbfs:/data/old.csv dbfs:/data/new.csv

# Remove files
databricks fs rm dbfs:/data/old_data.csv
```

**Databricks REST API:**

The REST API enables the same operations with direct HTTP requests:

**Authentication:**
```python
import requests

# Authentication
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {your_access_token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Base URL
base_url = "https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0"
```

**Working with Jobs:**
```python
# List jobs
response = requests.get(
    f"{base_url}/jobs/list",
    headers=headers
)
jobs = response.json()

# Run a job
job_id = 123
response = requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/jobs/run-now",
    headers=headers,
    json={"job_id": job_id}
)
run_id = response.json()["run_id"]

# Get run status
response = requests.get(
    f"{base_url}/jobs/runs/get",
    headers=headers,
    params={"run_id": run_id}
)
run_status = response.json()["state"]["life_cycle_state"]
```

**Creating a Job:**
```python
# Job definition
job_config = {
    "name": "API Created Job",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "task_key": "main_task",
            "notebook_task": {
                "notebook_path": "/Shared/MyNotebook",
                "base_parameters": {
                    "param1": "value1"
                }
            },
            "new_cluster": {
                "spark_version": "11.3.x-scala2.12",
                "node_type_id": "i3.xlarge",
                "num_workers": 2
            }
        }
    ],
    "schedule": {
        "quartz_cron_expression": "0 0 10 ? * MON-FRI",
        "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles"
    }
}

# Create job
response = requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/jobs/create",
    headers=headers,
    json=job_config
)
new_job_id = response.json()["job_id"]
```

**Automating Deployment with CI/CD:**

```python
import os
import requests
import json

# Function to deploy a notebook to production
def deploy_notebook(notebook_path, target_path):
    # Export from development workspace
    export_response = requests.get(
        f"{dev_workspace_url}/api/2.0/workspace/export",
        headers=dev_headers,
        params={
            "path": notebook_path,
            "format": "SOURCE"
        }
    )
    
    if export_response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to export: {export_response.text}")
    
    # Import to production workspace
    import_response = requests.post(
        f"{prod_workspace_url}/api/2.0/workspace/import",
        headers=prod_headers,
        json={
            "path": target_path,
            "format": "SOURCE",
            "content": export_response.json()["content"],
            "overwrite": True
        }
    )
    
    if import_response.status_code != 200:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to import: {import_response.text}")
    
    print(f"Successfully deployed {notebook_path} to {target_path}")

# Example usage in CI/CD pipeline
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Get environment variables (set by CI/CD system)
    dev_workspace = os.environ["DEV_WORKSPACE_URL"]
    dev_token = os.environ["DEV_TOKEN"]
    prod_workspace = os.environ["PROD_WORKSPACE_URL"]
    prod_token = os.environ["PROD_TOKEN"]
    
    # Set up headers
    dev_headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {dev_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    prod_headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {prod_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    # Deploy notebooks
    deploy_notebook("/Dev/ETL/ingest_data", "/Prod/ETL/ingest_data")
    deploy_notebook("/Dev/ETL/transform_data", "/Prod/ETL/transform_data")
    
    # Update job configuration
    # ... similar code to update job definitions
```

1. B - The transaction log records all changes (adds, removes, updates) to the table, enabling ACID properties and time travel.

2. A - Z-ordering is most effective on high-cardinality columns used in JOIN conditions, as it co-locates related data and enables efficient data skipping.

3. B - MERGE operations require that each source record matches at most one target record; multiple matches cause a runtime error.

4. C - For frequent filtering on both columns, partitioning by both date and region would create an efficient directory structure that enables partition pruning on either dimension.

5. B - repartition() performs a full shuffle to distribute data evenly, while coalesce() minimizes data movement when reducing partition count.

6. D - Both expressions are equivalent and configure a watermark that allows processing of events up to 2 hours late.

7. C - Complete mode requires an aggregation and outputs the entire result table each time, including all keys and updated values.

8. B - Broadcasting the static DataFrame (if small enough) eliminates the need for shuffling and improves join performance.

9. B - Deduplication typically occurs during the bronze to silver transformation, as silver tables should contain clean, validated, and deduplicated data.

10. B - expect_or_drop constraints in DLT will filter out records that don't meet the condition without failing the entire pipeline.

11. C - SCD Type 2 tracks historical changes by creating new records with start and end dates or current/historical flags.

12. B - Broadcast join is most efficient when joining with a small dimension table, as it eliminates shuffling by broadcasting the small table to all executors.

13. B - Watermarking with allowed lateness allows the stream to process late data within the defined threshold while enabling state cleanup.

14. A - VACUUM physically removes data files that are not referenced in the current or recent versions of the table.

15. C - Change Data Feed tracks row-level changes and enables incremental processing based on what has changed in the source.

16. C - Column masks in Unity Catalog provide a centralized, efficient way to implement column-level security across users and roles.

17. B - Unity Catalog provides unified governance across workspaces and clouds with a consistent security model and metadata management.

18. B - The Stages tab shows task distribution and duration, making it easy to identify skewed tasks where some take significantly longer than others.

19. A - Comparing processing rate to input rate reveals whether the streaming application can keep up with incoming data or is falling behind.

20. B - The dbutils.jobs.taskValues API allows tasks to set and retrieve values, enabling direct data passing between dependent tasks.

21. A - databricks workspace export is the correct command to export a notebook from Databricks to the local file system.

22. B - A shallow clone creates a reference to the original table's files but maintains its own transaction log, allowing independent modifications.

23. B - MEMORY_AND_DISK is appropriate for DataFrames that may not fit entirely in memory, as it will spill to disk as needed.

24. B - foreachBatch gives you complete control over how each micro-batch is processed, enabling complex logic that isn't possible with standard sinks.

25. B - APPLY CHANGES INTO is specifically designed for CDC processing, automatically handling inserts, updates, and deletes based on operation type.

26. D - For high-cardinality columns, using both Z-ORDER and bloom filter indices provides optimal query performance through data co-location and filtering.

27. C - Parameterizing notebooks and jobs allows the same code to be deployed across environments while adapting configurations based on the target environment.

28. C - High shuffle read/write metrics indicate excessive data movement across the cluster, often caused by operations like join, groupBy, or repartition.

29. B - The dataChange flag indicates whether the write operation should trigger downstream processing like table notifications or streaming queries.

30. B - MERGE with a targeted condition efficiently updates specific records without rewriting the entire table or requiring multiple operations.

### 5. Final Concept Clarification

Let's address some commonly confused concepts and provide final clarification:

**Delta Lake Table Types:**

- **Managed tables:**
  - Metadata stored in the metastore
  - Data stored in the default location (dbfs:/user/hive/warehouse/...)
  - Dropping the table deletes both metadata and data

- **External tables:**
  - Metadata stored in the metastore
  - Data stored in a specified location
  - Dropping the table deletes only metadata, not data

**Streaming vs. Batch Processing:**

|  | Streaming | Batch |
|---|---|---|
| **Data scope** | Unbounded | Bounded |
| **Processing model** | Continuous or micro-batch | Scheduled or triggered |
| **State management** | Required for aggregations | Generally stateless |
| **Latency** | Low (seconds to minutes) | High (minutes to hours) |
| **Fault tolerance** | Checkpointing | Job restart |
| **Use cases** | Real-time dashboards, alerts | Historical analysis, reporting |

**SCD Implementation Patterns:**

- **Type 1 (Overwrite):**
  ```python
  # Using MERGE
  deltaTable.alias("target").merge(
      updates.alias("updates"),
      "target.key = updates.key"
  ).whenMatched().updateAll().execute()
  ```

- **Type 2 (Historical):**
  ```python
  # Step 1: Expire current records
  deltaTable.alias("target").merge(
      updates.alias("updates"),
      "target.key = updates.key AND target.is_current = true"
  ).whenMatched().updateExpr({
      "is_current": "false",
      "end_date": "current_date()"
  })
  
  # Step 2: Insert new versions
  .whenNotMatched().insertExpr({
      "key": "updates.key",
      "attribute": "updates.attribute",
      "is_current": "true",
      "start_date": "current_date()",
      "end_date": "null"
  }).execute()
  ```

**Performance Optimization Decision Tree:**

1. **Issue: Slow overall job performance**
   - Check: Stage durations in Spark UI
   - If one stage dominates: Focus on that stage
   - If multiple stages are slow: Look for common factors

2. **Issue: Skewed tasks within a stage**
   - Check: Task duration distribution
   - Solutions:
     - Repartition with better key
     - Salting for skewed keys
     - AQE skew join optimization

3. **Issue: High shuffle read/write**
   - Solutions:
     - Reduce partition count
     - Broadcast small tables
     - Optimize join order
     - Pre-aggregate before join

4. **Issue: Out of memory errors**
   - Solutions:
     - Increase executor memory
     - Reduce parallelism
     - Cache selectively
     - Use disk persistence for large datasets

**Security Implementation Best Practices:**

1. **Table Access Control:**
   - Grant permissions at database/schema level where possible
   - Use role-based access control rather than individual users
   - Follow principle of least privilege

2. **Column Security:**
   - Use dynamic views for complex masking logic
   - Use column masks in Unity Catalog for consistent masking
   - Document sensitivity classifications

3. **Row-Level Security:**
   - Implement with row filters in Unity Catalog
   - Use dynamic views for complex filtering logic
   - Consider performance impact of filter predicates
