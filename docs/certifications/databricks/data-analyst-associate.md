## Databricks SQL Fundamentals & Lakehouse Architecture

### 1. Introduction to Databricks SQL

Databricks SQL is a service within the Databricks platform designed specifically for data analysis using SQL. It provides a familiar SQL interface while leveraging the power of Apache Spark in the background. As a data analyst, this tool allows you to query large datasets efficiently without needing to understand the complexities of distributed computing.

**Key Audience and Purpose:**

Databricks SQL primarily serves data analysts who need to:
- Query data directly using SQL syntax
- Create visualizations and dashboards from query results
- Share insights with stakeholders across an organization
- Perform analytics on large-scale data without specialized big data expertise

The service bridges the gap between traditional SQL analytics and modern big data processing, allowing analysts to work with massive datasets that wouldn't be feasible in traditional database systems.

**Components of Databricks SQL:**

1. **Query Editor**: Where you write and execute SQL statements
2. **SQL Warehouses/Endpoints**: Compute resources that process your queries
3. **Dashboards**: Interactive displays of multiple visualizations 
4. **Schema Browser**: Interface for exploring available databases and tables
5. **Visualizations**: Tools for creating charts and graphs from query results

---

### 2. Lakehouse Architecture and the Medallion Approach

The Lakehouse architecture combines the best aspects of data lakes and data warehouses, providing:
- The flexibility and scalability of data lakes
- The reliability, governance, and performance of data warehouses

**Traditional Data Architecture Challenges:**

- Data warehouses: Structured but limited scalability and high cost
- Data lakes: Highly scalable but lack structure and reliability
- Separate systems: Create data silos and complicated ETL processes

**Lakehouse Benefits:**

- Single platform for all data types and workloads
- Schema enforcement and governance
- ACID transactions through Delta Lake
- Direct access to source data
- Support for BI tools and machine learning

**The Medallion Architecture:**

This is a data organization approach within the Lakehouse that creates progressively refined data through three layers:

1. **Bronze Layer** (Raw Data):
   - Ingested data in its original form
   - Minimal or no transformations
   - Source of truth, preserving original data

2. **Silver Layer** (Validated/Cleansed):
   - Data with quality checks applied
   - Normalized and cleansed
   - Joined from multiple sources when necessary
   - Typically structured for efficient processing

3. **Gold Layer** (Business-Ready):
   - Highly refined data optimized for consumption
   - Aggregated and transformed for specific business domains
   - Optimized for query performance
   - Where data analysts primarily work

As a data analyst, you'll most frequently work with Gold layer tables, but understanding the entire architecture helps you navigate the data landscape and troubleshoot when needed.

---

### 3. SQL Query Fundamentals in Databricks

Databricks SQL uses a dialect that's compatible with ANSI SQL, with extensions that leverage Apache Spark's capabilities. Here's what you need to know:

**Basic Query Structure:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, function(column3) AS derived_value
FROM database_name.table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1
HAVING group_condition
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC]
LIMIT number;
```

**Databricks SQL Differentiators:**

- Support for Delta Lake tables with time travel capabilities
- Ability to query across different data sources
- Support for complex data types like arrays, maps, and structs
- Higher-order functions for working with these complex types
- Integration with machine learning functions

**Example Basic Query:**

```sql
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  SUM(order_amount) AS total_spend,
  COUNT(order_id) AS order_count,
  AVG(order_amount) AS average_order
FROM sales.orders
WHERE order_date >= '2022-01-01'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 5
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

---

### 4. SQL Endpoints/Warehouses Configuration

SQL Warehouses (also called endpoints) are the compute resources that execute your SQL queries in Databricks. Understanding their configuration is essential for both performance and cost management.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Serverless vs. Classic**: Serverless warehouses start quickly and don't require management, making them ideal for most analytical workloads.

2. **Sizing Options**: Warehouses range from 2X-Small to 4X-Large, with larger sizes providing more cores and memory.

3. **Auto-Stopping**: Warehouses can be configured to automatically stop after a period of inactivity (reducing costs).

4. **Scaling**: Warehouses can scale up and down based on query load.

**Practical Exercise 1: Configuring a SQL Warehouse**

Steps to configure your first SQL warehouse:
1. Navigate to SQL > SQL Warehouses
2. Click "Create"
3. Choose a name for your warehouse
4. Select "Serverless" type for quick start-up
5. Choose "2X-Small" size for development work
6. Set Auto-stop to 10 minutes
7. Click "Create"

**Considerations for Sizing:**
- Smaller warehouses: Lower cost, suitable for development and simple queries
- Larger warehouses: Better for complex queries, heavy concurrency, or large datasets
- Auto-stop time: Balance between availability and cost savings

---

### 5. Data Ingestion Methods in Databricks SQL

As a data analyst, you'll need to understand how data enters the Databricks environment. There are several methods available:

**Small-File Upload:**
- Suitable for reference tables, lookup data, or quick analysis
- Accessible through the Data tab in Databricks SQL
- Supports CSV, TSV, JSON, and other text formats
- Size limitations (typically up to 100MB)

**Object Storage Import:**
- For larger files stored in cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
- Requires proper access permissions
- Can import directories of files (if same structure)
- Supports partitioned data sources

**Partner Connect:**
- Integration with data ingestion tools like Fivetran
- Simplified setup for common data sources
- Creates necessary connections and resources automatically
- Requires partner account or subscription

**Practical Exercise 2: Importing a Small CSV File**

1. Navigate to Data > Upload File
2. Select a small CSV file from your computer
3. Choose database and table name
4. Review schema detection
5. Adjust data types if necessary
6. Choose "Create Table"
7. Verify the data with a simple SELECT query

---

### 6. Partner Connect Integration

Partner Connect allows you to easily integrate with third-party tools for data ingestion, visualization, and other services.

**Key Integration Categories:**
- Data Ingestion (Fivetran, Informatica)

## Data Management with Delta Lake

### 1. Delta Lake Fundamentals

Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes. As a critical component of the Databricks Lakehouse Platform, Delta Lake provides essential capabilities that make your data management more robust and efficient.

**Core Delta Lake Benefits:**

1. **ACID Transactions**: Delta Lake ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability for all operations, preventing data corruption during concurrent operations.

2. **Metadata Management**: Delta Lake maintains comprehensive metadata about your tables, including schema information, partitioning details, and transaction history.

3. **Time Travel**: Delta Lake preserves the history of data changes, allowing you to access and query previous versions of your data using timestamps or version numbers.

4. **Schema Enforcement and Evolution**: Delta Lake validates that incoming data adheres to the table's schema and supports controlled schema changes over time.

5. **Unified Batch and Streaming**: Delta Lake provides a consistent way to work with both batch and streaming data sources.

**Delta Lake Architecture:**

Delta Lake tables consist of three main components:

1. **Data Files**: Parquet files that contain the actual table data
2. **Transaction Log**: Records of all transactions and changes (stored in _delta_log directory)
3. **Checkpoint Files**: Periodic snapshots of table state for faster recovery and querying

**How Delta Lake Works Behind the Scenes:**

```
table_directory/
â”œâ”€â”€ _delta_log/                 # Transaction log directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 00000000000000000000.json  # First transaction
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 00000000000000000001.json  # Second transaction
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 00000000000000000010.checkpoint.parquet  # Checkpoint file
â”œâ”€â”€ part-00000-123abc.snappy.parquet  # Data file 1
â”œâ”€â”€ part-00001-456def.snappy.parquet  # Data file 2
â””â”€â”€ ...                           # More data files
```

When you perform operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE on a Delta table, Delta Lake:
1. Records the change in the transaction log
2. Updates or creates the necessary data files
3. Periodically creates checkpoint files for optimization

---

### 2. Table Management: Managed vs. Unmanaged Tables

In Databricks, understanding the distinction between managed and unmanaged tables is crucial for effective data management.

**Managed Tables:**

- Databricks manages both the metadata AND the data files
- When you drop a managed table, both the metadata and data are deleted
- Data files are stored in the default location within the Databricks workspace
- Created when you don't specify a LOCATION in your CREATE TABLE statement

```sql
-- Creating a managed table
CREATE TABLE managed_sales (
    id INT,
    product STRING,
    amount DOUBLE
);
```

**Unmanaged (External) Tables:**

- Databricks manages only the metadata, NOT the underlying data files
- When you drop an unmanaged table, only the metadata is deleted; data files remain
- Data files are stored in a location you specify (often in cloud storage)
- Created when you explicitly specify a LOCATION in your CREATE TABLE statement

```sql
-- Creating an unmanaged table
CREATE TABLE unmanaged_sales (
    id INT,
    product STRING,
    amount DOUBLE
)
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket/sales-data/';
```

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Managed Tables | Unmanaged Tables |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Data Files | Managed by Databricks | Managed by you |
| Location | Default Hive location | User-specified location |
| DROP TABLE behavior | Deletes data and metadata | Deletes only metadata |
| Use Case | Transient or temporary data | Persistent data shared across tools |
| Data Lifecycle | Tied to table lifecycle | Independent of table lifecycle |

**Identifying Table Type:**

You can determine if a table is managed or unmanaged by:

1. Using DESCRIBE EXTENDED:
```sql
DESCRIBE EXTENDED table_name;
```

2. Looking for "Type" in the output:
   - "MANAGED" for managed tables
   - "EXTERNAL" for unmanaged tables

3. Checking if "Location" points to the default Databricks location (managed) or a custom location (unmanaged)

---

### 3. Database and Table Operations

Effective data management requires familiarity with key database and table operations in Databricks SQL.

**Database Operations:**

1. **Creating Databases**:
```sql
-- Basic database creation
CREATE DATABASE sales_db;

-- With location specified
CREATE DATABASE marketing_db
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket/marketing-data/';

-- Creating if not exists
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS finance_db;
```

2. **Using Databases**:
```sql
-- Set current database
USE sales_db;

-- Qualify table names with database
SELECT * FROM marketing_db.campaigns;
```

3. **Dropping Databases**:
```sql
-- Drop empty database
DROP DATABASE finance_db;

-- Force drop even if it contains tables
DROP DATABASE marketing_db CASCADE;
```

**Table Operations:**

1. **Creating Tables**:
```sql
-- Create new empty table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT,
    name STRING,
    email STRING,
    signup_date DATE
);

-- Create table from query results
CREATE TABLE active_customers AS
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE last_activity_date > current_date() - INTERVAL 90 DAYS;

-- Create table with partitioning
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    amount DOUBLE,
    order_date DATE
)
PARTITIONED BY (order_date);
```

2. **Modifying Tables**:
```sql
-- Add a column
ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN phone STRING;

-- Drop a column
ALTER TABLE customers DROP COLUMN phone;

-- Rename a table
ALTER TABLE customers RENAME TO customers_renamed;
```

3. **Dropping Tables**:
```sql
-- Drop table
DROP TABLE customers;

-- Drop if exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temporary_customers;
```

---

### 4. Table Persistence and Scope

Understanding the persistence and scope of tables is essential for managing your data environment effectively.

**Persistence Levels:**

1. **Permanent Tables**:
   - Persist across sessions and clusters
   - Available to all users with appropriate permissions
   - Stored in the metastore and accessible by name

2. **Temporary Tables**:
   - Exist only within the current session
   - Automatically dropped when the session ends
   - Prefixed with "temp" or created with TEMPORARY keyword

```sql
-- Create a temporary table
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE session_metrics AS
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as page_views
FROM page_events
GROUP BY user_id;
```

3. **Global Temporary Tables**:
   - Available across all sessions within the same Spark application
   - Dropped when the Spark application ends
   - Must be qualified with "global_temp" schema

```sql
-- Create a global temporary table
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE app_metrics AS
SELECT app_id, AVG(response_time) as avg_response
FROM app_events
GROUP BY app_id;

-- Access global temporary table
SELECT * FROM global_temp.app_metrics;
```

**Database Scope Control:**

When creating databases, you can use the LOCATION parameter to control where the database stores its tables:

```sql
-- Create database with custom location
CREATE DATABASE sales_db
LOCATION 's3://your-bucket/sales-data/';
```

This affects all managed tables created in this database - they will be stored at the specified location rather than the default Hive warehouse directory.

---

### 5. Working with Views and Temp Views

Views are virtual tables based on the result set of a SQL statement. They don't store data themselves but provide a way to simplify complex queries and control access to data.

**Types of Views in Databricks:**

1. **Permanent Views**:
   - Persist across sessions and restarts
   - Stored in the metastore
   - Available to all users with appropriate permissions

```sql
-- Create a permanent view
CREATE VIEW customer_summary AS
SELECT 
  region,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count,
  SUM(total_spend) AS region_revenue
FROM customers
GROUP BY region;
```

2. **Temporary Views**:
   - Exist only within the current session
   - Automatically dropped when the session ends

```sql
-- Create a temporary view
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW active_users AS
SELECT user_id, last_activity_date
FROM users
WHERE last_activity_date > current_date() - INTERVAL 30 DAYS;
```

3. **Global Temporary Views**:
   - Available across all sessions within the same Spark application
   - Dropped when the Spark application ends
   - Must be qualified with "global_temp" schema

```sql
-- Create a global temporary view
CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY VIEW quarterly_sales AS
SELECT 
  QUARTER(order_date) AS quarter,
  SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(current_date())
GROUP BY QUARTER(order_date);

-- Access global temporary view
SELECT * FROM global_temp.quarterly_sales;
```

**Comparing Views and Tables:**

| Aspect | Views | Tables |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Data Storage | No data storage (query definition only) | Stores actual data |
| Update Frequency | Reflects current data when queried | Reflects data at time of creation/update |
| Performance | Computed each time when queried | Direct data access (faster) |
| Storage Space | Minimal (only metadata) | Requires space for full dataset |
| Use Case | Simplifying complex queries, access control | Storing persistent datasets |

**Practical Exercise 1: Creating and Using Views**

1. Create a permanent view that shows aggregated sales data:
```sql
CREATE VIEW sales_by_region AS
SELECT 
  region,
  product_category,
  SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region, product_category;
```

2. Create a temporary view for session-specific analysis:
```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW high_value_transactions AS
SELECT *
FROM transactions
WHERE amount > 10000;
```

3. Query and join both views:
```sql
SELECT 
  hvt.transaction_id,
  hvt.amount,
  sbr.region,
  sbr.total_sales AS region_total
FROM high_value_transactions hvt
JOIN sales_by_region sbr
  ON hvt.region = sbr.region
WHERE hvt.transaction_date > '2023-01-01';
```

### 6. Using Data Explorer for Data Management

Data Explorer in Databricks SQL provides a graphical interface for browsing and managing databases, tables, and views.

**Key Features of Data Explorer:**

1. **Schema Browser**:
   - Navigate through databases, tables, and views
   - See column names, data types, and comments
   - Preview table data with sample rows

2. **Table Details**:
   - View table properties and metadata
   - See storage information and statistics
   - Access table history (for Delta tables)

3. **Security Management**:
   - View and modify permissions
   - Control access at database and table levels
   - Manage ownership of data objects

**Practical Exercise 2: Exploring Data Objects**

1. Navigate to the "Data" tab in Databricks SQL
2. Browse through available databases
3. Select a table and review its schema
4. Preview the table data
5. Check table properties and history
6. Note the owner and permissions

---

### 7. Table Security and Access Control

Proper security management is crucial for protecting sensitive data and ensuring appropriate access.

**Key Security Concepts:**

1. **Ownership**:
   - Every table has an owner (creator by default)
   - Owners have full control over the table
   - Ownership can be transferred

2. **Permissions**:
   - SELECT: Ability to query the table
   - MODIFY: Ability to alter the table structure
   - CREATE: Ability to create new tables
   - ALL PRIVILEGES: Full control

3. **Access Control Commands**:

```sql
-- Grant select access
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE customer_data TO user@example.com;

-- Grant all privileges
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE marketing_db TO group_marketing;

-- Revoke access
REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE financial_data FROM user@example.com;

-- Show grants
SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE customer_data;
```

**Handling PII Data:**

Personal Identifiable Information (PII) requires special handling:

1. **Identify PII columns** in your datasets
2. **Implement access controls** to restrict who can view this data
3. **Consider masking or tokenization** for sensitive fields
4. **Document PII handling** according to organizational policies
5. **Audit access** to tables containing PII

**Practical Exercise 3: Managing Table Security**

1. Identify a table that would contain sensitive information
2. Use Data Explorer to view current permissions
3. Add a new permission to grant SELECT access to a specific user
4. Verify the changes to the permission structure
5. Document the access control strategy for this table

   d) Views always perform better than direct table queries

#### Knowledge Check Quiz - Answers

1. What happens to the data files when you drop a managed Delta table?
   **Answer: b) The files are deleted**
   
   With managed tables, Databricks controls both the metadata and the underlying data files. When you drop a managed table, both the metadata in the metastore and all associated data files are deleted permanently. This is an important distinction from unmanaged tables, where dropping the table only removes the metadata reference.

2. Which SQL command would you use to create an unmanaged table?
   **Answer: b) CREATE TABLE customers... LOCATION '...'**
   
   Adding the LOCATION parameter to your CREATE TABLE statement is what designates a table as unmanaged (external). This tells Databricks that you're managing the storage location of the data files independently, rather than allowing Databricks to determine the storage location.

3. What is the key difference between a temporary view and a permanent view?
   **Answer: b) Temporary views exist only for the current session**
   
   Temporary views are session-scoped objects that automatically disappear when your current session ends. In contrast, permanent views persist in the metastore and remain available across sessions, clusters, and to other users with appropriate permissions.

4. In Delta Lake, what is the purpose of the transaction log?
   **Answer: b) To record all changes made to the table**
   
   The transaction log is the cornerstone of Delta Lake's ACID compliance. It maintains a sequential record of all operations performed on the table, including inserts, updates, deletes, schema changes, and optimizations. This log enables time travel capabilities and ensures data consistency during concurrent operations.

5. Which statement about views is TRUE?
   **Answer: b) Views execute their defining query each time they are accessed**
   
   Unlike tables, views don't store data themselves but rather store the query definition. When you query a view, it executes its underlying SQL statement against the source tables each time, always returning the current data from those source tables.

#### Recommended Practice

To reinforce learning:
1. Create a managed and an unmanaged table, then identify the differences
2. Set up a view hierarchy with at least one permanent and one temporary view
3. Write a description of when you would use different table and view types
4. Practice granting and revoking permissions in the Data Explorer

## Advanced SQL in the Lakehouse

### 1. Advanced SQL Operations

Building on your foundation, today we dive into more sophisticated SQL capabilities in Databricks that allow you to perform complex data transformations and analysis.

**Beyond Basic SELECT Statements**

While basic SELECT statements form the foundation of SQL, Databricks SQL supports advanced clauses and operations for complex data manipulation:

```sql
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
  CASE 
    WHEN total_purchases > 10000 THEN 'Premium'
    WHEN total_purchases > 5000 THEN 'Gold'
    WHEN total_purchases > 1000 THEN 'Silver'
    ELSE 'Bronze'
  END AS customer_tier,
  DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), first_purchase_date, 'MONTH') AS customer_tenure_months
FROM customers
WHERE status = 'Active'
  AND (region = 'North America' OR region = 'Europe')
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM complaints WHERE complaints.customer_id = customers.customer_id)
ORDER BY total_purchases DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

This query demonstrates several advanced techniques:
- String manipulation with CONCAT
- Conditional logic with CASE statements
- Date calculations with DATE_DIFF
- Complex filtering with multiple conditions and subqueries
- Existence checks with NOT EXISTS

**Data Modification Operations**

Databricks SQL supports several methods for modifying data in tables:

1. **INSERT INTO**: Adds new rows to a table

```sql
-- Basic insert
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES (1001, 'John', 'Smith', 'john.smith@example.com');

-- Insert multiple rows
INSERT INTO customers
VALUES 
  (1002, 'Jane', 'Doe', 'jane.doe@example.com'),
  (1003, 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'robert.j@example.com');

-- Insert from query results
INSERT INTO active_customers
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email
FROM customers
WHERE last_activity_date > CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 90 DAYS;
```

2. **MERGE INTO**: Updates, inserts, or deletes rows based on a condition

```sql
MERGE INTO customers AS target
USING customer_updates AS source
ON target.customer_id = source.customer_id
WHEN MATCHED AND source.status = 'Inactive' THEN
  DELETE
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET
    target.email = source.email,
    target.last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, status, last_updated)
  VALUES (
    source.customer_id, 
    source.first_name, 
    source.last_name, 
    source.email, 
    source.status, 
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
  );
```

3. **COPY INTO**: Efficiently loads data from files into tables

```sql
COPY INTO sales
FROM 's3://data-bucket/new-sales/'
FILEFORMAT = CSV
FORMAT_OPTIONS ('header' = 'true', 'inferSchema' = 'true')
COPY_OPTIONS ('mergeSchema' = 'true');
```

**Comparison of Data Modification Methods**

| Method | Primary Use Case | Advantages | Limitations |
|--------|------------------|------------|-------------|
| INSERT INTO | Adding new data | Simple syntax, familiar | Cannot update existing data |
| MERGE INTO | Upserting data (update + insert) | Handles multiple operations in one statement | More complex syntax |
| COPY INTO | Bulk loading from files | Efficient for large data loads | Works with files, not query results |

### 2. Understanding JOIN Types and Their Applications

Joins are fundamental for combining data from multiple tables. Understanding the different types is crucial for accurate analysis.

**INNER JOIN**

Returns only matching rows from both tables. This is the most common join type.

```sql
SELECT 
  o.order_id,
  c.customer_name,
  o.order_date,
  o.total_amount
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c
  ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

**LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)**

Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If there's no match, NULL values are returned for right table columns.

```sql
SELECT 
  c.customer_id,
  c.customer_name,
  o.order_id,
  o.order_date
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

Use case: Finding all customers and their orders, including customers who haven't placed any orders.

**RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**

Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If there's no match, NULL values are returned for left table columns.

```sql
SELECT 
  o.order_id,
  p.product_name,
  o.quantity,
  o.unit_price
FROM order_items o
RIGHT JOIN products p
  ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
```

Use case: Finding all products and their orders, including products that haven't been ordered.

**FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)**

Returns all rows when there's a match in either the left or right table. NULL values are returned for non-matching sides.

```sql
SELECT 
  e.employee_id,
  e.employee_name,
  d.department_name
FROM employees e
FULL JOIN departments d
  ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

Use case: Finding all employees and departments, including employees not assigned to departments and departments without employees.

**CROSS JOIN**

Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (every row from the first table combined with every row from the second table).

```sql
SELECT 
  p.product_name,
  c.category_name
FROM products p
CROSS JOIN categories c;
```

Use case: Creating combinations of all possible values, such as a product matrix or date dimension table.

**SELF JOIN**

Joining a table to itself, typically using different aliases.

```sql
SELECT 
  e.employee_name AS employee,
  m.employee_name AS manager
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m
  ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

Use case: Handling hierarchical data like organizational structures or category hierarchies.

---

### 3. Subqueries and Optimization

Subqueries (queries nested within other queries) are powerful tools for complex data analysis but require careful optimization.

**Types of Subqueries**

1. **Scalar Subqueries**: Return a single value

```sql
SELECT 
  product_name,
  price,
  (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products) AS average_price,
  price - (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products) AS price_difference
FROM products;
```

2. **Row Subqueries**: Return a single row with multiple columns

```sql
SELECT 
  department_name,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department_id = d.department_id) AS employee_count
FROM departments d;
```

3. **Table Subqueries**: Return multiple rows and columns

```sql
SELECT 
  c.customer_name,
  o.order_count,
  o.total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count,
    SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_id
) o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

4. **Correlated Subqueries**: Reference columns from the outer query

```sql
SELECT 
  product_name,
  category,
  price,
  (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products p2 WHERE p2.category = p1.category) AS category_avg_price
FROM products p1
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products p2 WHERE p2.category = p1.category);
```

**Optimizing Subqueries**

Subqueries can impact performance if not used carefully. Here are optimization strategies:

1. **Use JOINs instead of correlated subqueries** when possible
   
   Instead of:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     c.customer_name,
     (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id) AS order_count
   FROM customers c;
   ```
   
   Use:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     c.customer_name,
     COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
   FROM customers c
   LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
   GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name;
   ```

2. **Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for readability and reuse

   ```sql
   WITH customer_orders AS (
     SELECT 
       customer_id,
       COUNT(*) AS order_count,
       SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
     FROM orders
     GROUP BY customer_id
   )
   SELECT 
     c.customer_name,
     co.order_count,
     co.total_spent
   FROM customers c
   JOIN customer_orders co ON c.customer_id = co.customer_id;
   ```

3. **Materialize frequently used subqueries** as temporary tables or views

   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW high_value_customers AS
   SELECT 
     customer_id,
     SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY customer_id
   HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 10000;
   
   -- Now use this view in multiple queries
   SELECT * FROM high_value_customers;
   ```

4. **Push predicates into subqueries** to filter early

   Instead of:
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM (
     SELECT * FROM orders
   ) o
   WHERE o.order_date > '2023-01-01';
   ```
   
   Use:
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM (
     SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2023-01-01'
   ) o;
   ```

### 4. Aggregations and Window Functions

Aggregation functions and window functions are essential tools for data analysis that allow you to summarize and compare data across different dimensions.

**Basic Aggregation Functions**

These functions operate on a set of rows to return a single value:

```sql
SELECT 
  category,
  COUNT(*) AS product_count,
  AVG(price) AS avg_price,
  MIN(price) AS min_price,
  MAX(price) AS max_price,
  SUM(inventory) AS total_inventory
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
```

**Advanced Aggregation Techniques**

1. **GROUPING SETS**: Allows you to specify multiple grouping sets in a single query

```sql
SELECT 
  COALESCE(region, 'All Regions') AS region,
  COALESCE(category, 'All Categories') AS category,
  SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (
  (region, category),
  (region),
  (category),
  ()
);
```

2. **CUBE**: Generates all possible grouping sets based on the specified columns

```sql
SELECT 
  COALESCE(region, 'All Regions') AS region,
  COALESCE(category, 'All Categories') AS category,
  COALESCE(CAST(year AS STRING), 'All Years') AS year,
  SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY CUBE(region, category, year);
```

3. **ROLLUP**: Generates a subset of grouping sets based on a hierarchy

```sql
SELECT 
  COALESCE(region, 'All Regions') AS region,
  COALESCE(state, 'All States') AS state,
  COALESCE(city, 'All Cities') AS city,
  SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY ROLLUP(region, state, city);
```

**Window Functions**

Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without collapsing the result into a single output row.

1. **Ranking Functions**

```sql
SELECT 
  category,
  product_name,
  price,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price DESC) AS price_rank,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price DESC) AS price_dense_rank,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price DESC) AS price_row_number
FROM products;
```

2. **Analytic Functions**

```sql
SELECT 
  product_name,
  category,
  price,
  AVG(price) OVER (PARTITION BY category) AS category_avg_price,
  price - AVG(price) OVER (PARTITION BY category) AS price_diff_from_avg,
  price / SUM(price) OVER (PARTITION BY category) * 100 AS pct_of_category_price
FROM products;
```

3. **Window Functions with Frames**

```sql
SELECT 
  order_date,
  order_id,
  total_amount,
  SUM(total_amount) OVER (
    ORDER BY order_date
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS running_total,
  AVG(total_amount) OVER (
    ORDER BY order_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING
  ) AS moving_avg_5day
FROM orders;
```

**Practical Exercise 1: Working with Aggregations and Window Functions**

1. Write a query that calculates year-over-year growth by quarter:

```sql
SELECT 
  year,
  quarter,
  total_sales,
  LAG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter ORDER BY year) AS prev_year_sales,
  (total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter ORDER BY year)) / 
    LAG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY quarter ORDER BY year) * 100 AS yoy_growth_pct
FROM (
  SELECT 
    YEAR(order_date) AS year,
    QUARTER(order_date) AS quarter,
    SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), QUARTER(order_date)
) quarterly_sales
ORDER BY year, quarter;
```

2. Identify the top 3 products in each category by sales volume:

```sql
WITH product_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.category,
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.category ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity) DESC) AS sales_rank
  FROM products p
  JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
  GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, p.category
)
SELECT 
  product_id,
  product_name,
  category,
  total_quantity_sold
FROM product_sales
WHERE sales_rank <= 3
ORDER BY category, sales_rank;
```

---

### 5. Managing Nested Data Formats

Databricks SQL excels at handling complex, nested data structures that are common in modern data lakes.

**Types of Nested Data Structures**

1. **Arrays**: Ordered collections of elements

```sql
-- Creating a table with array columns
CREATE TABLE users (
  user_id INT,
  name STRING,
  interests ARRAY<STRING>,
  purchase_amounts ARRAY<DOUBLE>
);

-- Inserting data with arrays
INSERT INTO users VALUES
  (1, 'Alice', ARRAY('hiking', 'reading', 'cooking'), ARRAY(120.50, 25.00, 75.99)),
  (2, 'Bob', ARRAY('gaming', 'photography'), ARRAY(249.99, 525.50));
```

2. **Maps**: Key-value pairs

```sql
-- Creating a table with map columns
CREATE TABLE product_attributes (
  product_id INT,
  name STRING,
  specifications MAP<STRING, STRING>
);

-- Inserting data with maps
INSERT INTO product_attributes VALUES
  (101, 'Smartphone', MAP('color', 'black', 'storage', '128GB', 'ram', '8GB')),
  (102, 'Laptop', MAP('color', 'silver', 'storage', '512GB', 'ram', '16GB'));
```

3. **Structs**: Records with named fields

```sql
-- Creating a table with struct columns
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT,
  customer_id INT,
  shipping_address STRUCT<street: STRING, city: STRING, zip: STRING>,
  billing_address STRUCT<street: STRING, city: STRING, zip: STRING>
);

-- Inserting data with structs
INSERT INTO orders VALUES
  (1001, 5001, 
   STRUCT('123 Main St', 'Portland', '97201'), 
   STRUCT('123 Main St', 'Portland', '97201')),
  (1002, 5002, 
   STRUCT('456 Oak Ave', 'Seattle', '98101'), 
   STRUCT('789 Pine Dr', 'New York', '10001'));
```

**Querying Nested Data**

1. **Working with Arrays**

```sql
-- Accessing array elements
SELECT 
  user_id,
  name,
  interests[0] AS primary_interest,
  size(interests) AS interest_count
FROM users;

-- Exploding arrays
SELECT 
  user_id,
  name,
  exploded_interest
FROM users
LATERAL VIEW explode(interests) AS exploded_interest;

-- Filtering with array containment
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE array_contains(interests, 'hiking');

-- Aggregating arrays
SELECT 
  user_id,
  name,
  array_join(interests, ', ') AS interest_list,
  array_min(purchase_amounts) AS min_purchase,
  array_max(purchase_amounts) AS max_purchase,
  array_sum(purchase_amounts) AS total_spent
FROM users;
```

2. **Working with Maps**

```sql
-- Accessing map values
SELECT 
  product_id,
  name,
  specifications['color'] AS color,
  specifications['storage'] AS storage
FROM product_attributes;

-- Exploding maps
SELECT 
  product_id,
  name,
  spec_name,
  spec_value
FROM product_attributes
LATERAL VIEW explode(specifications) AS spec_name, spec_value;

-- Filtering with map keys
SELECT *
FROM product_attributes
WHERE map_keys(specifications) ARRAY_CONTAINS 'ram';
```

3. **Working with Structs**

```sql
-- Accessing struct fields
SELECT 
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  shipping_address.street AS shipping_street,
  shipping_address.city AS shipping_city,
  billing_address.zip AS billing_zip
FROM orders;

-- Comparing struct fields
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE shipping_address = billing_address;
```

**Practical Exercise 2: Working with Nested Data**

1. Create a table with nested structures and insert sample data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_transactions (
  customer_id INT,
  name STRING,
  transactions ARRAY<STRUCT
    transaction_id: STRING,
    date: DATE,
    amount: DOUBLE,
    items: ARRAY<STRUCT
      item_id: INT,
      item_name: STRING,
      quantity: INT,
      price: DOUBLE
    >>
  >>
);

INSERT INTO customer_transactions VALUES
  (1, 'Alice', ARRAY(
    STRUCT('T1001', DATE '2023-01-15', 125.40, ARRAY(
      STRUCT(101, 'Product A', 2, 45.50),
      STRUCT(102, 'Product B', 1, 34.40)
    )),
    STRUCT('T1002', DATE '2023-02-20', 85.00, ARRAY(
      STRUCT(103, 'Product C', 1, 85.00)
    ))
  )),
  (2, 'Bob', ARRAY(
    STRUCT('T2001', DATE '2023-01-05', 200.00, ARRAY(
      STRUCT(101, 'Product A', 1, 45.50),
      STRUCT(104, 'Product D', 1, 154.50)
    ))
  ));
```

2. Query to extract all purchased items and their quantities:

```sql
SELECT 
  ct.customer_id,
  ct.name,
  t.transaction_id,
  t.date,
  i.item_name,
  i.quantity,
  i.price,
  i.quantity * i.price AS line_total
FROM customer_transactions ct
LATERAL VIEW explode(transactions) AS t
LATERAL VIEW explode(t.items) AS i
ORDER BY ct.customer_id, t.date, i.item_name;
```

---

### 6. Query Performance Optimization

Optimizing query performance is crucial for efficient data analysis, especially with large datasets.

**Key Optimization Techniques**

1. **Filtering Early**: Push filters as early as possible in the query

```sql
-- Instead of this
SELECT 
  c.customer_name,
  o.order_date,
  o.total_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date > '2023-01-01';

-- Do this
SELECT 
  c.customer_name,
  o.order_date,
  o.total_amount
FROM customers c
JOIN (
  SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2023-01-01'
) o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

2. **Projection Pruning**: Select only the columns you need

```sql
-- Instead of this
SELECT * FROM customers JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

-- Do this
SELECT 
  customers.customer_name,
  orders.order_id,
  orders.order_date,
  orders.total_amount
FROM customers 
JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

3. **Partition Pruning**: Limit scanned partitions when using partitioned tables

```sql
-- For a table partitioned by date
SELECT *
FROM sales_data
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31';
```

4. **Avoiding Cartesian Products**: Be cautious with CROSS JOINs and ensure proper join conditions

5. **Using Appropriate Join Types**: Choose the right join type based on your data and requirements

6. **Leveraging Query Caching**: Databricks SQL caches query results for improved performance

```sql
-- Check if query results are cached
SELECT * FROM samples.nyctaxi.trips LIMIT 10;
-- Run again to use cached results
```

7. **Using Query History**: Review past queries for optimization opportunities

**Higher-Order Functions**

Spark SQL provides higher-order functions for working efficiently with complex data types:

1. **transform**: Applies a function to each element in an array

```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  name,
  interests,
  transform(interests, i -> upper(i)) AS uppercase_interests
FROM users;
```

2. **filter**: Selects elements from an array based on a condition

```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  name,
  purchase_amounts,
  filter(purchase_amounts, a -> a > 100) AS large_purchases
FROM users;
```

3. **exists**: Checks if any element in an array satisfies a condition

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE exists(purchase_amounts, a -> a > 500);
```

4. **aggregate**: Reduces an array to a single value

```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  name,
  purchase_amounts,
  aggregate(purchase_amounts, 0, (acc, x) -> acc + x) AS total_spent
FROM users;
```

**User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**

UDFs allow you to extend SQL functionality with custom logic:

```sql
-- Creating a simple UDF
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
RETURN (celsius * 9/5) + 32;

-- Using the UDF
SELECT 
  city,
  temperature_celsius,
  celsius_to_fahrenheit(temperature_celsius) AS temperature_fahrenheit
FROM weather_data;
```

**Practical Exercise 3: Performance Optimization**

1. Analyze a slow query and optimize it:

Original query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales s
JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE s.sale_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

Optimized query:
```sql
SELECT 
  s.sale_id,
  s.sale_date,
  s.quantity,
  s.total_amount,
  c.customer_name,
  c.customer_email,
  p.product_name,
  p.category
FROM (
  SELECT * FROM sales 
  WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
) s
JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id;
```

2. Create and use a UDF for a common calculation:

```sql
-- Create a UDF to calculate discount price
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_discount(price DOUBLE, discount_pct DOUBLE)
RETURNS DOUBLE
RETURN price * (1 - discount_pct/100);

-- Use the UDF in a query
SELECT 
  product_id,
  product_name,
  price AS original_price,
  discount_percentage,
  calculate_discount(price, discount_percentage) AS discounted_price
FROM products;
```

   b) CTEs can be reused multiple times in the same query
   c) CTEs support recursion
   d) CTEs are easier to update

#### Knowledge Check Quiz - Answers

1. Which SQL operation would you use to simultaneously insert, update, and delete rows in a target table based on values from a source table?
   **Answer: c) MERGE**
   
   The MERGE operation is designed specifically for this purpose, allowing you to perform multiple data manipulation actions in a single statement. It matches rows between source and target tables, then applies different actions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) based on whether matches are found and any additional conditions you specify.

2. When using a window function, what does PARTITION BY do?
   **Answer: b) Divides the result set into groups for which the window function is applied separately**
   
   PARTITION BY creates logical divisions in your data. The window function calculations are performed independently within each partition, similar to how GROUP BY works for aggregations, but without collapsing the rows. This allows for more sophisticated analytical calculations while maintaining the detail rows.

3. Which join type returns all rows from both tables, with NULL values for non-matching rows?
   **Answer: d) FULL JOIN**
   
   A FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN) returns all rows from both tables. When there's no match for a row in either table, NULL values are returned for columns from the non-matching table. This join type is useful when you need to see all data from both tables regardless of whether relationships exist.

4. Which higher-order function would you use to filter elements from an array based on a condition?
   **Answer: b) filter()**
   
   The filter() function takes an array and a lambda function that specifies a filtering condition. It returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy that condition. This is especially useful when working with array columns in nested data structures.

5. What is the primary advantage of using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) over subqueries?
   **Answer: b) CTEs can be reused multiple times in the same query**
   
   While CTEs offer several benefits (including improved readability and support for recursion), their ability to be referenced multiple times within the same query is a key advantage. With a CTE, you define a complex intermediate result set once and can then reference it in multiple places, eliminating the need to repeat the same subquery logic.

#### Recommended Practice

To reinforce learning:
1. Write a query using window functions to calculate month-over-month growth rates
2. Create a complex JOIN scenario involving at least three tables
3. Practice working with nested data structures using higher-order functions
4. Write and use a custom UDF to solve a specific analytical problem
5. Optimize a complex query and measure the performance improvement

### 5. Creating Schema-Specific Visualizations

Let's practice creating visualizations tailored to specific data schemas and analytical needs.

**Practical Exercise 1: Sales Performance Dashboard**

Start with a query that retrieves sales data:

```sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('month', order_date) AS month,
  region,
  product_category,
  SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count,
  SUM(sales_amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS avg_customer_spend
FROM sales
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY date_trunc('month', order_date), region, product_category
ORDER BY month, region, product_category;
```

Using this query result, create the following visualizations:

1. **Line Chart: Monthly Sales Trend**
   - X-axis: month
   - Y-axis: total_sales
   - Series: product_category
   - Formatting: Add title "2023 Monthly Sales by Product Category"
   - Customize colors for each product category
   - Add data labels for the last month

2. **Bar Chart: Regional Performance**
   - X-axis: region
   - Y-axis: total_sales
   - Group by: product_category
   - Sorting: Descending by total sales
   - Formatting: Add title "Regional Sales by Product Category"
   - Display values as stacked bars

3. **Pivot Table: Detailed Breakdown**
   - Rows: region, product_category
   - Columns: month
   - Values: total_sales (sum), customer_count (count)
   - Formatting: Add conditional formatting to highlight cells above target

4. **Counter: Total Annual Sales**
   - Primary value: SUM(total_sales)
   - Comparison: Previous year (if available)

  acquisition_channel,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count,
  AVG(lifetime_value) AS avg_ltv,
  SUM(total_orders) AS order_count,
  SUM(total_orders) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS avg_orders_per_customer,
  SUM(total_spend) / SUM(total_orders) AS avg_order_value
FROM customers
GROUP BY customer_segment, acquisition_channel
ORDER BY customer_segment, acquisition_channel;
```

Using this query result, create the following visualizations:

1. **Donut Chart: Customer Distribution by Segment**
   - Segments: customer_segment
   - Values: customer_count
   - Formatting: Add percentage labels, custom colors by segment
   - Add title "Customer Distribution by Segment"

2. **Horizontal Bar Chart: Average Lifetime Value by Segment and Channel**

### 7. Using Query Parameters for Dynamic Dashboards

Query parameters enable interactive filtering and dynamic content in dashboards, allowing users to explore data without writing SQL.

**Types of Dashboard Parameters:**

1. **Text Parameters:** For string inputs like names or codes
2. **Number Parameters:** For numerical inputs like thresholds or IDs
3. **Date Parameters:** For time period selection
4. **Dropdown Parameters:** For selecting from predefined options
5. **Query-Based Dropdown:** For options populated by query results

**Creating and Using Parameters:**

1. Define parameter in the query editor:
```sql
-- Parameter definition
-- Type: Date
-- Name: start_date
-- Default: 2023-01-01

-- Using parameter in query
SELECT 
  date_trunc('month', order_date) AS month,
  SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
WHERE order_date >= '{{start_date}}'
GROUP BY date_trunc('month', order_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

2. Create query-based dropdown parameters:
```sql
-- Query to populate dropdown options
SELECT DISTINCT region FROM sales ORDER BY region;

-- Main query using the parameter
SELECT 
  product_category,
  SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
WHERE region = '{{selected_region}}'
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

**Practical Exercise 4: Adding Parameters to Sales Dashboard**

1. Create the following parameters for the sales dashboard:
   - Date range parameter (start_date and end_date)
   - Region dropdown (populated from distinct regions)
   - Product category multiselect dropdown
   
2. Modify the sales query to use these parameters:
```sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('month', order_date) AS month,
  region,
  product_category,
  SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count,
  SUM(sales_amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS avg_customer_spend
FROM sales
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '{{start_date}}' AND '{{end_date}}'
  AND region = '{{selected_region}}'
  AND product_category IN ({{selected_categories}})
GROUP BY date_trunc('month', order_date), region, product_category
ORDER BY month, region, product_category;
```

3. Apply parameters to all visualizations in the dashboard
4. Test the dashboard interactivity by changing parameter values

---

### 9. Alert Configuration and Management

Alerts automatically monitor your data and notify stakeholders when metrics reach specific thresholds.

**Alert Components:**

1. **Source Query:** SQL query that retrieves the monitored metric
2. **Condition:** Threshold or criteria that triggers the alert
3. **Schedule:** How frequently to check the condition
4. **Notification:** Who receives alerts and through which channels
5. **State Tracking:** Alert history and current status

**Setting Up Basic Alerts:**

1. Create or select a query that returns the metric to monitor
2. Define alert condition (e.g., value above/below threshold)
3. Set checking frequency
4. Configure notification recipients and channels
5. Add descriptive name and context for the alert

**Alert Best Practices:**

- **Clear Naming:** Use descriptive names that indicate the condition and impact
- **Context:** Include sufficient information in notifications to understand the issue
- **Thresholds:** Set appropriate thresholds to avoid alert fatigue
- **Recipients:** Target alerts to people who can take action
- **Escalation:** Create tiered alert levels for different severities
- **Documentation:** Maintain documentation on expected actions for each alert

**Practical Exercise 6: Creating Alerts for Key Metrics**

1. Create a low inventory alert:
```sql
SELECT 
  product_id,
  product_name,
  current_stock,
  reorder_level
FROM inventory
WHERE current_stock < reorder_level;
```
   - Set to trigger when any products are below reorder level
   - Schedule to check daily at 8:00 AM
   - Notify inventory management team

2. Create a sales performance alert:
```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(sales_amount) AS daily_sales,
  (SELECT AVG(daily_total) FROM daily_sales_targets) AS daily_target,
  SUM(sales_amount) / (SELECT AVG(daily_total) FROM daily_sales_targets) * 100 AS target_percentage
FROM sales
WHERE sale_date = CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;
```
   - Set to trigger when daily sales fall below 80% of target
   - Schedule to check daily at 9:00 AM
   - Notify sales management team

5. When creating a query-based dropdown parameter, what type of query should you write?
   a) A query that returns exactly one column with distinct values
   b) A query that returns multiple columns with distinct combinations
   c) A query that returns a single row with multiple columns
   d) A query that returns aggregated summary data

#### Knowledge Check Quiz - Answers

1. Which visualization type is most appropriate for showing part-to-whole relationships across categories?
   **Answer: c) Pie or donut chart**
   
   Pie and donut charts are specifically designed to represent proportional parts of a whole. Each slice visually represents a category's proportion of the total, making these chart types ideal for showing percentage distributions or composition across categories.

2. What is the primary purpose of using dashboard parameters?
   **Answer: b) To allow users to interactively filter and explore data**
   
   Dashboard parameters enable non-technical users to interact with data visualizations by changing filter values without writing SQL. This interactive capability allows stakeholders to explore different segments of data, change time periods, or focus on specific categories, all while maintaining the dashboard's overall structure and relationships.

3. When setting up a dashboard refresh schedule, which consideration is most important to prevent refresh failures?
   **Answer: c) SQL warehouse availability**
   
   SQL warehouse availability is critical because if the warehouse has auto-stopped due to inactivity when a scheduled refresh occurs, the refresh will fail. When configuring refresh schedules, you must ensure that either the warehouse will be running at the scheduled time or that auto-start functionality is properly configured.

4. Which statement about visualizations in Databricks SQL is FALSE?
   **Answer: c) Visualizations automatically update when the underlying data changes**
   
   This statement is false. Visualizations reflect the data as of the last query execution. They only update when the query is manually run or when triggered by a scheduled refresh. Changes to the underlying data are not automatically reflected until the next query execution.

5. When creating a query-based dropdown parameter, what type of query should you write?
   **Answer: a) A query that returns exactly one column with distinct values**
   
   A query-based dropdown parameter requires a query that returns a single column containing the distinct values that will populate the dropdown options. This query defines the available choices for the parameter, such as product categories, regions, or time periods that users can select from.

#### Recommended Practice

To reinforce learning:
1. Create a comprehensive dashboard with at least four different visualization types
2. Implement at least two different parameter types for interactive filtering
3. Configure appropriate formatting for each visualization
4. Set up a refresh schedule and sharing settings
5. Create an alert for a key business metric

## Analytics Applications & Final Exam Preparation

### 1. Descriptive Statistics Fundamentals

Statistical analysis forms the foundation of data-driven decision making. As a data analyst using Databricks, understanding how to calculate and interpret descriptive statistics is essential for deriving meaningful insights from your data.

**Discrete vs. Continuous Statistics**

Understanding the distinction between discrete and continuous data is critical for selecting appropriate analytical methods:

**Discrete Statistics** deal with countable data that takes specific, separate values:
- Customer counts
- Number of transactions
- Product quantities
- Binary outcomes (yes/no, success/failure)

**Continuous Statistics** involve measurements that can take any value within a range:
- Revenue amounts
- Time durations
- Temperature readings
- Percentages

**Key Statistical Measures**

Descriptive statistics are grouped into several categories:

**Measures of Central Tendency** describe the center or typical value of a distribution:

1. **Mean (Average)**: Sum of all values divided by the count
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(order_amount) AS mean_order_value 
   FROM orders;
   ```

2. **Median**: Middle value when data is arranged in order
   ```sql
   SELECT percentile_approx(order_amount, 0.5) AS median_order_value 
   FROM orders;
   ```

3. **Mode**: Most frequently occurring value
   ```sql
   SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) AS frequency
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY product_id
   ORDER BY frequency DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```

**Measures of Dispersion** describe how spread out the data is:

1. **Range**: Difference between maximum and minimum values
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     MAX(order_amount) - MIN(order_amount) AS order_amount_range 
   FROM orders;
   ```

2. **Variance**: Average of squared deviations from the mean
   ```sql
   SELECT VARIANCE(order_amount) AS order_amount_variance
   FROM orders;
   ```

3. **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance
   ```sql
   SELECT STDDEV(order_amount) AS order_amount_stddev
   FROM orders;
   ```

4. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Difference between 75th and 25th percentiles
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     percentile_approx(order_amount, 0.75) - percentile_approx(order_amount, 0.25) AS order_amount_iqr
   FROM orders;
   ```

**Distribution Moments** describe the shape of the data distribution:

1. **Skewness**: Measures asymmetry of the distribution
   - Positive skew: Right tail is longer (most values are lower)
   - Negative skew: Left tail is longer (most values are higher)
   - Zero skew: Symmetrical distribution

2. **Kurtosis**: Measures the "tailedness" of the distribution
   - High kurtosis: Heavy tails, more outliers
   - Low kurtosis: Light tails, fewer outliers

**Practical Statistics Applications in Data Analysis**

1. **Outlier Detection** using statistical methods:
   ```sql
   WITH stats AS (
     SELECT 
       AVG(order_amount) AS mean,
       STDDEV(order_amount) AS stddev
     FROM orders
   )
   SELECT 
     order_id,
     order_amount
   FROM orders, stats
   WHERE order_amount > mean + 3 * stddev  -- 3 standard deviations above mean
     OR order_amount < mean - 3 * stddev;  -- 3 standard deviations below mean
   ```

2. **Z-Score Calculation** to standardize values:
   ```sql
   WITH stats AS (
     SELECT 
       AVG(order_amount) AS mean,
       STDDEV(order_amount) AS stddev
     FROM orders
   )
   SELECT 
     order_id,
     order_amount,
     (order_amount - mean) / stddev AS z_score
   FROM orders, stats;
   ```

3. **Percentile Analysis** for understanding distribution:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     percentile_approx(order_amount, array(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9)) AS order_amount_percentiles
   FROM orders;
   ```

### 2. Data Enhancement and Blending Techniques

Data enhancement involves enriching your datasets with additional information to provide deeper insights. Data blending combines information from multiple sources into a cohesive analytical view.

**Data Enhancement Approaches**

1. **Attribute Derivation**: Creating new columns from existing data
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     customer_id,
     first_purchase_date,
     last_purchase_date,
     datediff(last_purchase_date, first_purchase_date) AS customer_lifespan_days,
     COUNT(order_id) AS order_count,
     SUM(order_amount) AS total_spend,
     SUM(order_amount) / COUNT(order_id) AS average_order_value
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY customer_id, first_purchase_date, last_purchase_date;
   ```

2. **Classification and Segmentation**: Categorizing data based on attributes
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     customer_id,
     total_spend,
     CASE 
       WHEN total_spend >= 10000 THEN 'High Value'
       WHEN total_spend >= 5000 THEN 'Medium Value'
       ELSE 'Low Value'
     END AS customer_segment
   FROM customer_summary;
   ```

3. **Temporal Enrichment**: Adding time-based dimensions
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     order_id,
     order_date,
     DAYOFWEEK(order_date) AS day_of_week,
     WEEKOFYEAR(order_date) AS week_of_year,
     MONTH(order_date) AS month,
     QUARTER(order_date) AS quarter,
     YEAR(order_date) AS year,
     CASE 
       WHEN MONTH(order_date) IN (12, 1, 2) THEN 'Winter'
       WHEN MONTH(order_date) IN (3, 4, 5) THEN 'Spring'
       WHEN MONTH(order_date) IN (6, 7, 8) THEN 'Summer'
       ELSE 'Fall'
     END AS season
   FROM orders;
   ```

4. **Geographical Enrichment**: Adding location-based attributes
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     store_id,
     city,
     state,
     region,
     CASE
       WHEN region = 'Northeast' OR region = 'Midwest' THEN 'Eastern Division'
       ELSE 'Western Division'
     END AS division,
     CASE
       WHEN state IN ('CA', 'OR', 'WA') THEN 'West Coast'
       WHEN state IN ('NY', 'NJ', 'CT') THEN 'Tri-State Area'
       ELSE 'Other'
     END AS market_zone
   FROM store_locations;
   ```

**Data Blending Techniques**

1. **Entity Resolution**: Matching and consolidating records from different sources
   ```sql
   -- Matching customers across two systems
   SELECT 
     a.customer_id AS system_a_id,
     b.customer_id AS system_b_id,
     a.email,
     a.name AS system_a_name,
     b.name AS system_b_name
   FROM system_a_customers a
   JOIN system_b_customers b 
     ON LOWER(a.email) = LOWER(b.email)
     OR (a.phone = b.phone AND a.phone IS NOT NULL);
   ```

2. **Dimensional Enrichment**: Adding context from dimension tables
   ```sql
   -- Enriching sales transactions with product and customer dimensions
   SELECT 
     s.transaction_id,
     s.transaction_date,
     s.quantity,
     s.unit_price,
     s.quantity * s.unit_price AS total_amount,
     p.product_name,
     p.category,
     p.brand,
     c.customer_name,
     c.segment,
     c.acquisition_channel
   FROM sales_transactions s
   JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
   JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id;
   ```

3. **Temporal Alignment**: Matching data from different time periods
   ```sql
   -- Aligning weekly sales with marketing campaigns
   SELECT 
     w.week_start_date,
     w.week_end_date,
     w.weekly_sales,
     w.store_id,
     COALESCE(c.campaign_name, 'No Campaign') AS campaign_name,
     COALESCE(c.campaign_type, 'None') AS campaign_type,
     COALESCE(c.campaign_budget, 0) AS campaign_budget
   FROM weekly_sales w
   LEFT JOIN marketing_campaigns c 
     ON w.week_start_date <= c.end_date
     AND w.week_end_date >= c.start_date
     AND w.region = c.target_region;
   ```

**Last-Mile ETL**

Last-mile ETL refers to the final transformations performed by analysts to prepare data for specific analytical needs. This typically occurs after data has already been processed through formal ETL pipelines and landed in the gold layer of your data lake.

**Key characteristics of last-mile ETL:**

1. **Purpose-specific transformations** tailored to a particular analysis
2. **Performed by analysts** rather than data engineers
3. **Often ad-hoc** or project-specific rather than production pipelines
4. **Focuses on analytical readiness** rather than data quality or integration

**Common last-mile ETL operations:**

1. **Dataset combination** for specific analytical needs
   ```sql
   -- Combining data for a marketing analysis
   CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW marketing_analysis AS
   SELECT 
     c.customer_id,
     c.acquisition_date,
     c.acquisition_channel,
     COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count,
     SUM(o.order_amount) AS total_spend,
     AVG(s.satisfaction_score) AS avg_satisfaction,
     MAX(o.order_date) AS last_order_date
   FROM customers c
   LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
   LEFT JOIN satisfaction_surveys s ON o.order_id = s.order_id
   GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.acquisition_date, c.acquisition_channel;
   ```

2. **Metric calculation** for specific KPIs
   ```sql
   -- Creating customer lifetime value metrics
   CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW customer_ltv AS
   SELECT 
     customer_id,
     SUM(order_amount) AS total_spend,
     COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_count,
     DATEDIFF(MAX(order_date), MIN(order_date)) / 30 AS customer_tenure_months,
     SUM(order_amount) / NULLIF(DATEDIFF(MAX(order_date), MIN(order_date)) / 30, 0) AS monthly_value
   FROM orders
   GROUP BY customer_id;
   ```

3. **Time period alignment** for reporting needs
   ```sql
   -- Aligning data to fiscal year for financial reporting
   CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW fiscal_year_performance AS
   SELECT 
     CASE 
       WHEN MONTH(transaction_date) >= 7 THEN YEAR(transaction_date)
       ELSE YEAR(transaction_date) - 1
     END AS fiscal_year,
     CASE 
       WHEN MONTH(transaction_date) >= 7 THEN MONTH(transaction_date) - 6
       ELSE MONTH(transaction_date) + 6
     END AS fiscal_month,
     SUM(amount) AS total_amount
   FROM transactions
   GROUP BY fiscal_year, fiscal_month
   ORDER BY fiscal_year, fiscal_month;
   ```

### 3. Common Analytics Applications

Understanding common analytics application patterns allows you to quickly implement solutions for frequent business needs.

**Customer Analytics Applications**

1. **Cohort Analysis**: Tracking groups of customers based on shared characteristics
   ```sql
   -- Monthly cohort retention analysis
   WITH cohorts AS (
     SELECT 
       customer_id,
       DATE_FORMAT(first_purchase_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS cohort_month,
       first_purchase_date
     FROM (
       SELECT 
         customer_id,
         MIN(order_date) AS first_purchase_date
       FROM orders
       GROUP BY customer_id
     )
   ),
   customer_activity AS (
     SELECT 
       c.customer_id,
       c.cohort_month,
       DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS activity_month,
       MONTHS_BETWEEN(DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, 'yyyy-MM-01'), 
                     DATE_FORMAT(c.first_purchase_date, 'yyyy-MM-01')) AS month_number
     FROM cohorts c
     JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
   )
   SELECT 
     cohort_month,
     COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cohort_size,
     SUM(CASE WHEN month_number = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100 AS month_0_retention,

       NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(order_id)) AS f_score,
       NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(order_amount)) AS m_score
     FROM orders
     GROUP BY customer_id
   )
   SELECT 
     customer_id,
     recency,
     frequency,
     monetary,
     r_score,
     f_score,
     m_score,
     CONCAT(r_score, f_score, m_score) AS rfm_score,
     CASE 
       WHEN r_score >= 4 AND f_score >= 4 AND m_score >= 4 THEN 'Champions'
       WHEN r_score >= 3 AND f_score >= 3 AND m_score >= 3 THEN 'Loyal Customers'
       WHEN r_score >= 3 AND f_score >= 1 AND m_score >= 2 THEN 'Potential Loyalists'
       WHEN r_score >= 4 AND f_score <= 2 AND m_score <= 2 THEN 'New Customers'
       WHEN r_score <= 2 AND f_score >= 3 AND m_score >= 3 THEN 'At Risk'
       WHEN r_score <= 2 AND f_score >= 2 AND m_score >= 2 THEN 'Needs Attention'
       WHEN r_score <= 1 AND f_score >= 4 AND m_score >= 4 THEN 'Can\'t Lose Them'
       WHEN r_score <= 2 AND f_score <= 2 AND m_score <= 2 THEN 'Hibernating'
       ELSE 'Others'
     END AS segment
   FROM customer_rfm;
   ```

**Product Analytics Applications**

1. **Product Affinity Analysis**: Identifying frequently co-purchased products
   ```sql
   -- Market basket analysis
   WITH order_pairs AS (
     SELECT 
       o1.order_id,
       p1.product_id AS product_1,
       p1.product_name AS product_1_name,
       p2.product_id AS product_2,
       p2.product_name AS product_2_name
     FROM order_items o1
     JOIN order_items o2 
       ON o1.order_id = o2.order_id 
       AND o1.product_id < o2.product_id
     JOIN products p1 ON o1.product_id = p1.product_id
     JOIN products p2 ON o2.product_id = p2.product_id

     COUNT(*) AS co_occurrence_count
   FROM order_pairs
   GROUP BY product_1, product_1_name, product_2, product_2_name
   ORDER BY co_occurrence_count DESC;
   ```

2. **Product Performance Analysis**: Evaluating product metrics over time
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     p.product_id,
     p.product_name,
     p.category,
     DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS month,
     COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS order_count,
     SUM(oi.quantity) AS units_sold,
     SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS revenue,
     SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) / SUM(oi.quantity) AS average_selling_price,
     SUM(oi.quantity * (oi.unit_price - p.cost)) AS gross_profit,
     SUM(oi.quantity * (oi.unit_price - p.cost)) / SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) * 100 AS profit_margin
   FROM products p
   JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
   JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
   GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, p.category, DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, 'yyyy-MM')
   ORDER BY month, revenue DESC;
   ```

**Operational Analytics Applications**

     CASE 
       WHEN ABS((ds.daily_total - ss.mean_daily_sales) / ss.stddev_daily_sales) > 2 THEN 'Anomaly'
       ELSE 'Normal'
     END AS status
   FROM daily_sales ds, sales_stats ss
   ORDER BY ABS((ds.daily_total - ss.mean_daily_sales) / ss.stddev_daily_sales) DESC;
   ```

### 4. Applying Analytics Techniques

Let's practice implementing some of the analytics applications we've discussed.

**Practical Exercise 1: Customer Segmentation and Analysis**

Implement a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using RFM:

```sql
-- Step 1: Calculate base RFM metrics
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW customer_rfm_base AS
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), MAX(order_date)) AS recency_days,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS frequency,
  SUM(order_amount) AS monetary
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Step 2: Create RFM scores
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW customer_rfm_scores AS
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  recency_days,
  frequency,
  monetary,
  NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY recency_days ASC) AS recency_score,
  NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS frequency_score,
  NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY monetary DESC) AS monetary_score
FROM customer_rfm_base;

-- Step 3: Create segments
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW customer_segments AS
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  recency_days,
  frequency,
  monetary,
  recency_score,
  frequency_score,
  monetary_score,
  (recency_score + frequency_score + monetary_score) / 3.0 AS average_score,
  CASE 
    WHEN recency_score >= 4 AND frequency_score >= 4 AND monetary_score >= 4 THEN 'Champions'
    WHEN recency_score >= 4 AND frequency_score >= 3 AND monetary_score >= 3 THEN 'Loyal Customers'
    WHEN recency_score >= 3 AND frequency_score >= 1 AND monetary_score >= 2 THEN 'Potential Loyalists'
    WHEN recency_score >= 4 AND frequency_score <= 2 AND monetary_score <= 2 THEN 'New Customers'
    WHEN recency_score <= 2 AND frequency_score >= 3 AND monetary_score >= 3 THEN 'At Risk'
    WHEN recency_score <= 2 AND frequency_score >= 2 AND monetary_score >= 2 THEN 'Needs Attention'
    WHEN recency_score <= 1 AND frequency_score >= 4 AND monetary_score >= 4 THEN 'Can\'t Lose Them'
    WHEN recency_score <= 2 AND frequency_score <= 2 AND monetary_score <= 2 THEN 'Hibernating'
    WHEN recency_score <= 1 AND frequency_score <= 1 AND monetary_score <= 1 THEN 'Lost'
    ELSE 'Others'
  END AS segment
FROM customer_rfm_scores;

-- Step 4: Analyze segment characteristics
SELECT 
  segment,
  COUNT(*) AS customer_count,
  ROUND(AVG(recency_days), 1) AS avg_recency,
  ROUND(AVG(frequency), 1) AS avg_frequency,
  ROUND(AVG(monetary), 2) AS avg_monetary,
  ROUND(SUM(monetary) / SUM(SUM(monetary)) OVER () * 100, 2) AS pct_total_revenue
FROM customer_segments
GROUP BY segment
ORDER BY avg_recency, avg_monetary DESC;
```

**Practical Exercise 2: Cohort Retention Analysis**

Implement a monthly cohort retention analysis:

```sql
-- Step 1: Identify first purchase month for each customer
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW customer_cohorts AS
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  DATE_FORMAT(MIN(order_date), 'yyyy-MM') AS cohort_month
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Step 2: Calculate activity for each customer by month
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW customer_monthly_activity AS
SELECT 
  c.customer_id,
  c.cohort_month,
  DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS activity_month,
  CAST(MONTHS_BETWEEN(TO_DATE(DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, 'yyyy-MM-01')), 
                     TO_DATE(DATE_FORMAT(MIN(o.order_date) OVER (PARTITION BY c.customer_id), 'yyyy-MM-01'))) 
       AS INT) AS month_number
FROM customer_cohorts c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- Step 3: Build cohort retention grid
SELECT 
  cohort_month,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS cohort_size,
  SUM(CASE WHEN month_number = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100 AS month_0_retention,
  SUM(CASE WHEN month_number = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100 AS month_1_retention,
  SUM(CASE WHEN month_number = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100 AS month_2_retention,
  SUM(CASE WHEN month_number = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100 AS month_3_retention,
  SUM(CASE WHEN month_number = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100 AS month_4_retention,
  SUM(CASE WHEN month_number = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100 AS month_5_retention,
  SUM(CASE WHEN month_number = 6 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100 AS month_6_retention
FROM customer_monthly_activity
GROUP BY cohort_month
ORDER BY cohort_month;
```

### Comprehensive Practice Exam - Answers

#### Databricks SQL Section

1. A data analyst needs to create a dashboard that will be viewed by executives who do not have direct access to Databricks. What is the best way to share this dashboard?
   **Answer: b) Share a link that uses the dashboard owner's credentials**
   
   Explanation: This option allows executives without Databricks access to view the dashboard through a shared link that authenticates as the dashboard creator, enabling access without requiring Databricks accounts for the viewers.

2. When setting up a Databricks SQL warehouse, which configuration would be most cost-effective for a dashboard that refreshes hourly during business hours?
   **Answer: a) 2X-Small with auto-stop set to 10 minutes**
   
   Explanation: This configuration uses the smallest warehouse size suitable for the workload while automatically stopping after 10 minutes of inactivity, minimizing costs between hourly refreshes.

3. Which statement about the medallion architecture is FALSE?
   **Answer: d) Data analysts typically work primarily with bronze layer data**
   
   Explanation: This statement is false because data analysts primarily work with gold layer data, which contains business-ready, transformed metrics. Bronze layer contains raw, unprocessed data that typically requires further transformation before analysis.

#### Data Management Section

4. What happens to the data files when you drop an unmanaged Delta table?
   **Answer: c) The data files remain untouched**
   
   Explanation: For unmanaged (external) tables, Databricks only manages the metadata. When dropping an unmanaged table, only the metadata definition is removed while the underlying data files remain in their specified location.

5. You need to create a view that will be available only during your current session. Which SQL statement should you use?
   **Answer: b) CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW my_view AS SELECT...**
   
   Explanation: Temporary views exist only for the duration of the current session and are automatically dropped when the session ends, making them appropriate for session-specific data analysis.

6. Which statement about Delta Lake is TRUE?
   **Answer: c) Delta Lake provides ACID transaction guarantees**
   
   Explanation: Delta Lake ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) for all operations, which is one of its key benefits over traditional data lake storage formats.

#### SQL in the Lakehouse Section

7. Which join type will return all rows from both tables, including unmatched rows?
   **Answer: d) FULL JOIN**
   
   Explanation: A FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN) returns all rows from both tables, with NULL values for columns from the non-matching table when there is no match between the tables.

8. What is the purpose of the MERGE statement in Databricks SQL?
   **Answer: b) To update, insert, or delete rows based on matching conditions**
   
   Explanation: MERGE allows for simultaneous insert, update, and delete operations based on matching conditions between source and target tables, enabling efficient upsert operations in a single statement.

9. You need to find the rolling 7-day average of daily sales. Which SQL feature would be most appropriate?
   **Answer: b) Window functions**
   
   Explanation: Window functions allow calculations across a specified range of rows related to the current row, making them ideal for computing rolling averages over time periods.

10. Which higher-order function would you use to apply a transformation to each element in an array column?
    **Answer: b) transform()**
    
    Explanation: The transform() function applies a lambda function to each element in an array, returning a new array with the transformed values, perfect for element-wise transformations.

#### Data Visualization and Dashboarding Section

11. Which visualization type is most appropriate for showing the proportion of sales by product category?
    **Answer: c) Pie chart**
    
    Explanation: Pie charts are specifically designed to show part-to-whole relationships, making them suitable for displaying proportional distribution across categories.

12. What is the primary benefit of using query parameters in dashboards?
    **Answer: c) They allow users to interact with the dashboard without writing SQL**
    
    Explanation: Query parameters enable non-technical users to filter and customize dashboard data through interactive controls without needing to modify or understand the underlying SQL code.

13. When configuring a dashboard refresh schedule, what should you consider to avoid refresh failures?
    **Answer: a) The SQL warehouse auto-stop settings**
    
    Explanation: If the SQL warehouse has auto-stopped when a scheduled refresh occurs, the refresh will fail. Warehouse auto-stop settings must align with scheduled refresh times to ensure the warehouse is available.

#### Analytics Applications Section

14. Which statistical measure represents the middle value in a sorted dataset?
    **Answer: b) Median**
    
    Explanation: The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset, with an equal number of values above and below it, making it resistant to outliers compared to the mean.

15. In a cohort analysis, what defines a cohort?
    **Answer: c) Customers who joined during the same time period**
    
    Explanation: Cohorts are typically defined by when customers joined (acquisition date/month/quarter), allowing analysis of behavior over time for groups that started their journey at the same point.

16. What is the purpose of data enhancement in analytics applications?
    **Answer: c) To enrich datasets with additional attributes or derived information**
    
    Explanation: Data enhancement involves adding new calculated fields, classifications, or attributes that weren't in the original dataset to provide additional analytical context and insights.
