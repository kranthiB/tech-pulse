# Knowledge Base

## Foundation Building & Databricks ML Environment

### 1. Introduction to Databricks Interface and Runtime for ML

#### Databricks Workspace Overview

The Databricks workspace is a web-based interface that provides:

- **Notebooks**: Interactive documents combining code, visualizations, and markdown
- **Repos**: Git-based version control for your code
- **Data**: Access to tables, databases, and files
- **Compute**: Management of clusters for running your workloads
- **Workflows**: Orchestration of jobs and pipelines
- **Machine Learning**: Tools for model development, tracking, and deployment

#### Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning (DBML)

DBML is a specialized runtime that includes:

- Pre-installed libraries for ML (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Optimized versions of ML frameworks
- Pre-configured environment for distributed ML workloads
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Horovod for distributed deep learning

To create a cluster with DBML:
1. Navigate to Compute section in the workspace
2. Click "Create Cluster"
3. Select "Machine Learning" runtime version
4. Configure your cluster resources based on workload requirements

**Key Differences from Standard Runtime:**
- Pre-installed ML libraries
- GPU support and acceleration
- Integration with MLflow
- Optimized for model training and inference

---

### 2. Setting Up Clusters and Repositories with Git Integration

#### Cluster Configuration Best Practices

When configuring a Databricks cluster for ML workloads:

1. **Cluster Mode**:
   - **Standard**: For most ML workloads
   - **Single Node**: For small datasets or non-distributed tasks

2. **Node Type Selection**:
   - CPU-optimized for data processing and traditional ML
   - GPU-accelerated for deep learning

3. **Autoscaling**:
   - Enable to automatically adjust cluster size based on workload
   - Set minimum and maximum workers appropriately

4. **Spark Configurations**:
   - `spark.databricks.io.cache.enabled`: Set to true for improved data access
   - `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`: Adjust based on dataset size

#### Git Integration with Databricks Repos

Databricks Repos allows you to:
- Connect to existing Git repositories
- Create and manage branches
- Commit and push changes
- Pull updates from remote repositories

**Setting up Git integration:**
1. Navigate to Repos in the sidebar
2. Click "Add Repo"
3. Select Git provider (GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, etc.)
4. Enter repository URL
5. Authorize connection to your Git provider

**Working with Repos:**
- Checkout branches using the dropdown menu
- Create new branches with the "+" button
- Commit changes using the Git icon in notebooks
- Pull latest changes using the "Pull" button

---

### 3. Understanding Notebook Workflows and Basic Spark Concepts

#### Databricks Notebooks

Databricks notebooks provide:
- Multi-language support (Python, SQL, R, Scala)
- Integrated visualizations
- Collaboration features
- Version control

**Key Notebook Features:**
- **Magic Commands**: Special commands prefixed with `%`
  - `%sql`: Run SQL queries
  - `%md`: Write markdown
  - `%run`: Execute another notebook
  - `%pip`: Install Python packages

- **Widgets**: Interactive controls for parameterizing notebooks
  - Text inputs, dropdowns, and checkboxes
  - Created with `dbutils.widgets` commands

#### Fundamental Spark Concepts for ML

**Spark Architecture:**
- Driver node: Coordinates execution
- Worker nodes: Perform computations

**Core Abstractions:**
- **SparkSession**: Entry point to Spark functionality
  ```python
  spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ML Example").getOrCreate()
  ```

- **DataFrame**: Distributed collection of data
  ```python
  df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("/path/to/data.csv")
  ```

- **Transformations vs. Actions**:
  - Transformations (e.g., `select()`, `filter()`) are lazy
  - Actions (e.g., `count()`, `collect()`) trigger execution

- **Partitioning**: How data is distributed across the cluster
  ```python
  # Repartition to 8 partitions
  df_repartitioned = df.repartition(8)
  ```

### 5. Feature Store Concepts and Usage

#### Databricks Feature Store Overview

Feature Store provides:
- Centralized repository for features
- Feature sharing across projects
- Point-in-time correctness
- Consistent feature transformations

**Key Components:**
- **Feature Tables**: Collections of features
- **Feature Lookups**: Methods to retrieve features
- **Online Stores**: Low-latency feature serving
- **Feature Search**: Discovery of existing features

#### Creating and Using Feature Tables

**Creating a Feature Table:**
```python
from databricks.feature_store import FeatureStoreClient

fs = FeatureStoreClient()

# Create feature dataframe
features_df = spark.table("customer_data")
  .select("customer_id", "recency", "frequency", "monetary")

# Create feature table
fs.create_table(
  name="customer_features",
  primary_keys=["customer_id"],
  df=features_df,
  description="Customer RFM features"
)
```

**Feature Lookup for Training:**
```python
from databricks.feature_store import FeatureLookup

# Define feature lookup
feature_lookups = [
  FeatureLookup(
    table_name="customer_features",
    feature_names=["recency", "frequency", "monetary"],
    lookup_key=["customer_id"]
  )
]

# Create training dataset with features
training_set = fs.create_training_set(
  df=training_df,
  feature_lookups=feature_lookups,
  label="churned"
)

# Get dataframe with features
training_df = training_set.load_df()
```

**Batch Scoring with Feature Store:**
```python
predictions = fs.score_batch(
  model_uri="models:/customer_churn/production",
  df=batch_df
)
```

### 6. MLflow Tracking and Model Registry

#### MLflow Tracking

MLflow Tracking records:
- Parameters
- Metrics
- Artifacts
- Models
- Environment information

**Tracking Experiments:**
```python
import mlflow

# Start a run
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="gradient_boost"):
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("learning_rate", 0.1)
    mlflow.log_param("max_depth", 5)
    
    # Train model
    model = train_model(learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=5)
    
    # Log metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.85)
    mlflow.log_metric("f1_score", 0.82)
    
    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

**Viewing Experiments:**
1. Navigate to the Experiments tab in the ML section
2. Select your experiment
3. Compare runs, parameters, and metrics
4. View artifacts and model details

#### MLflow Model Registry

The Model Registry provides:
- Model versioning
- Stage transitions (Development, Staging, Production)
- Model lineage
- Deployment management

**Registering a Model:**
```python
# Register model from a run
model_uri = f"runs:/{run_id}/model"
registered_model = mlflow.register_model(model_uri, "customer_churn")

# Register model from a local path
registered_model = mlflow.register_model("file:///path/to/model", "customer_churn")
```

**Managing Model Lifecycle:**
```python
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()

# Transition model to staging
client.transition_model_version_stage(
  name="customer_churn",
  version=1,
  stage="Staging"
)

# Add description
client.update_model_version(
  name="customer_churn",
  version=1,
  description="Gradient boosting model with hyperparameter tuning"
)
```
