#### Fundamental Spark Concepts for ML

**Spark Architecture:**
- Driver node: Coordinates execution
- Worker nodes: Perform computations

**Core Abstractions:**
- **SparkSession**: Entry point to Spark functionality
  ```python
  spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ML Example").getOrCreate()
  ```

- **DataFrame**: Distributed collection of data
  ```python
  df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").load("/path/to/data.csv")
  ```

- **Transformations vs. Actions**:
  - Transformations (e.g., `select()`, `filter()`) are lazy
  - Actions (e.g., `count()`, `collect()`) trigger execution

- **Partitioning**: How data is distributed across the cluster
  ```python
  # Repartition to 8 partitions
  df_repartitioned = df.repartition(8)
  ```

## ML Workflows & Data Preparation

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis in Databricks

#### Data Understanding Fundamentals

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the critical first step in any machine learning workflow, helping you:

- Understand data distributions and relationships
- Identify data quality issues
- Discover patterns and anomalies
- Inform feature engineering and modeling decisions

#### EDA Techniques in Databricks

**Basic DataFrame Exploration:**

```python
# Load data
df = spark.table("customer_data")

# Overview of dataset
print(f"Number of rows: {df.count()}")
print(f"Number of columns: {len(df.columns)}")
display(df.limit(5))

# Schema information
df.printSchema()

# Summary statistics
display(df.summary())
```

**Using dbutils for Data Summarization:**

```python
# Comprehensive data profile
display(dbutils.data.summarize(df))
```

**Statistical Analysis with Spark:**

```python
# Descriptive statistics
display(df.describe())

# Correlation analysis
from pyspark.ml.stat import Correlation
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

numeric_cols = [field.name for field in df.schema.fields if field.dataType.typeName() in ["double", "integer", "float"]]
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=numeric_cols, outputCol="features")
df_vector = assembler.transform(df).select("features")
matrix = Correlation.corr(df_vector, "features").collect()[0][0]
display(matrix.toArray())
```

**Visualization with Databricks Display Functions:**

```python
# Histogram of numeric column
display(df.select("age"))

# Bar chart for categorical data
display(df.groupBy("category").count())

# Scatter plot between two variables
display(df.select("income", "spending"))
```

**Advanced Visualizations with Python Libraries:**

```python
# Convert to pandas for visualization (small datasets only)
pandas_df = df.limit(10000).toPandas()

# Matplotlib example
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(pandas_df['age'], bins=20)
plt.title('Age Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Count')
display(plt.gcf())

# Seaborn example
import seaborn as sns
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.heatmap(pandas_df[numeric_cols].corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
display(plt.gcf())
```

---

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Techniques

#### Identifying Data Quality Issues

**Check for Missing Values:**

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, isnan, when, count

# Count missing values for each column
missing_values = df.select([count(when(col(c).isNull() | isnan(col(c)), c)).alias(c) for c in df.columns])
display(missing_values)

# Calculate percentage of missing values
total_rows = df.count()
for column in df.columns:
    missing_count = df.filter(col(column).isNull() | isnan(col(column))).count()
    missing_percentage = (missing_count / total_rows) * 100
    print(f"{column}: {missing_percentage:.2f}% missing")
```

**Identify Duplicate Records:**

```python
# Count total duplicates
duplicate_count = df.count() - df.dropDuplicates().count()
print(f"Number of duplicate records: {duplicate_count}")

# Find examples of duplicates
duplicate_rows = df.exceptAll(df.dropDuplicates())
display(duplicate_rows.limit(5))
```

**Check for Inconsistent Values:**

```python
# Check for inconsistent categories
display(df.groupBy("category").count().orderBy("count"))

# Check for outliers using box plot
display(df.select("income"))
```

#### Data Cleaning Operations

**Handle Duplicates:**

```python
# Remove all duplicate rows
df_clean = df.dropDuplicates()

# Remove duplicates based on specific columns
df_clean = df.dropDuplicates(["customer_id", "transaction_date"])
```

**Filter Irrelevant Data:**

```python
# Remove rows with specific conditions
df_clean = df.filter(col("age") > 0)
df_clean = df_clean.filter(col("income").isNotNull())

# Filter out rows from before a certain date
from pyspark.sql.functions import to_date
df_clean = df_clean.filter(to_date(col("transaction_date"), "yyyy-MM-dd") >= "2020-01-01")
```

**Basic Column Operations:**

```python
# Select specific columns
df_clean = df.select("customer_id", "age", "income", "spending")

# Rename columns
df_clean = df_clean.withColumnRenamed("spending", "monthly_spending")

# Add a new column
from pyspark.sql.functions import expr
df_clean = df_clean.withColumn("spending_ratio", expr("monthly_spending / income"))

# Drop columns
df_clean = df_clean.drop("temp_column", "internal_id")
```

### 3. Feature Engineering Fundamentals

#### What is Feature Engineering?

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem, resulting in improved model performance. Good features:

- Capture relevant patterns in the data
- Have a clear relationship with the target variable
- Are in a format suitable for the model

#### Feature Engineering Techniques

**Numeric Transformations:**

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import log, sqrt, pow, round

# Log transformation (for skewed data)
df = df.withColumn("log_income", log(col("income")))

# Square root transformation
df = df.withColumn("sqrt_distance", sqrt(col("distance")))

# Polynomial features
df = df.withColumn("age_squared", pow(col("age"), 2))

# Binning numeric values
df = df.withColumn("income_group", 
                   when(col("income") < 30000, "low")
                   .when(col("income") < 70000, "medium")
                   .otherwise("high"))
```

**Date and Time Features:**

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import year, month, dayofweek, hour, datediff, current_date

# Extract components from timestamp
df = df.withColumn("purchase_year", year(col("purchase_date")))
df = df.withColumn("purchase_month", month(col("purchase_date")))
df = df.withColumn("purchase_dayofweek", dayofweek(col("purchase_date")))
df = df.withColumn("purchase_hour", hour(col("purchase_time")))

# Calculate time differences
df = df.withColumn("days_since_purchase", datediff(current_date(), col("purchase_date")))

# Cyclical encoding for month (to capture seasonality)
from pyspark.sql.functions import sin, cos, lit, radians
df = df.withColumn("month_sin", sin(col("purchase_month") * 2 * 3.14159 / 12))
df = df.withColumn("month_cos", cos(col("purchase_month") * 2 * 3.14159 / 12))
```

**Text Features:**

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import length, split, size, lower, regexp_replace

# Basic text features
df = df.withColumn("text_length", length(col("description")))
df = df.withColumn("word_count", size(split(col("description"), " ")))

# Text cleaning
df = df.withColumn("clean_text", 
                   regexp_replace(lower(col("description")), "[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]", ""))
```

**Aggregation Features:**

```python
# Group and aggregation
agg_df = df.groupBy("customer_id").agg(
    count("transaction_id").alias("transaction_count"),
    sum("amount").alias("total_spent"),
    avg("amount").alias("avg_transaction"),
    max("amount").alias("max_transaction")
)

# Join back to main dataset
df = df.join(agg_df, "customer_id")
```

---

### 4. Handling Missing Values and Outliers

#### Missing Value Strategies

**Analyzing Missing Patterns:**

```python
# Visualize missing value patterns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Convert to pandas for visualization (small datasets only)
pandas_df = df.limit(10000).toPandas()

# Create missing value map
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(pandas_df.isnull(), cbar=False, yticklabels=False, cmap='viridis')
plt.title('Missing Value Pattern')
display(plt.gcf())
```

**Dropping Missing Values:**

```python
# Drop rows with any missing values (use cautiously)
df_clean = df.na.drop()

# Drop rows where specific columns have missing values
df_clean = df.na.drop(subset=["income", "age"])

# Drop columns with high percentage of missing values
missing_percentages = {}
total_rows = df.count()
for column in df.columns:
    missing_count = df.filter(col(column).isNull()).count()
    missing_percentages[column] = (missing_count / total_rows) * 100

columns_to_drop = [col for col, pct in missing_percentages.items() if pct > 50]
df_clean = df.drop(*columns_to_drop)
```

**Imputing Missing Values:**

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import Imputer

# Create an imputer for numeric columns
numeric_cols = ["age", "income", "spending"]
imputer = Imputer(
    inputCols=numeric_cols, 
    outputCols=[f"{col}_imputed" for col in numeric_cols]
).setStrategy("mean")  # Options: "mean", "median", "mode"

# Fit and transform
imputer_model = imputer.fit(df)
df_imputed = imputer_model.transform(df)

# Manual imputation for categorical columns
from pyspark.sql.functions import lit
most_common_category = df.groupBy("category").count().orderBy("count", ascending=False).first()["category"]
df_imputed = df_imputed.withColumn(
    "category",
    when(col("category").isNull(), most_common_category).otherwise(col("category"))
)
```

#### Outlier Detection and Handling

**Statistical Detection:**

```python
# Z-score method
from pyspark.sql.functions import avg, stddev

# Calculate z-scores
income_stats = df.select(
    avg("income").alias("avg_income"),
    stddev("income").alias("stddev_income")
).collect()[0]

df = df.withColumn("income_zscore", 
                  (col("income") - income_stats["avg_income"]) / income_stats["stddev_income"])

# Filter outliers
df_no_outliers = df.filter(abs(col("income_zscore")) < 3)
```

**IQR Method:**

```python
# Calculate Q1, Q3 and IQR
quantiles = df.stat.approxQuantile("income", [0.25, 0.75], 0.05)
Q1 = quantiles[0]
Q3 = quantiles[1]
IQR = Q3 - Q1

# Define bounds
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# Filter outliers
df_no_outliers = df.filter((col("income") >= lower_bound) & (col("income") <= upper_bound))
```

**Capping Outliers:**

```python
# Cap values at lower and upper bounds instead of removing
df_capped = df.withColumn(
    "income_capped",
    when(col("income") < lower_bound, lower_bound)
    .when(col("income") > upper_bound, upper_bound)
    .otherwise(col("income"))
)
```

### 5. Feature Transformation Techniques

#### Scaling and Normalization

Many ML algorithms are sensitive to the scale of numeric features. Scaling ensures all features contribute equally to model training.

**Techniques using Spark ML:**

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, MaxAbsScaler
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

# Prepare vector of features to scale
numeric_cols = ["age", "income", "spending", "tenure"]
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=numeric_cols, outputCol="features_vector")
df_vector = assembler.transform(df)

# StandardScaler: (value - mean) / stddev
scaler = StandardScaler(
    inputCol="features_vector", 
    outputCol="scaled_features",
    withMean=True,
    withStd=True
)
scaler_model = scaler.fit(df_vector)
df_scaled = scaler_model.transform(df_vector)

# MinMaxScaler: (value - min) / (max - min)
min_max_scaler = MinMaxScaler(
    inputCol="features_vector", 
    outputCol="scaled_features"
)
min_max_model = min_max_scaler.fit(df_vector)
df_min_max = min_max_model.transform(df_vector)

# MaxAbsScaler: value / max(abs(value))
max_abs_scaler = MaxAbsScaler(
    inputCol="features_vector", 
    outputCol="scaled_features"
)
max_abs_model = max_abs_scaler.fit(df_vector)
df_max_abs = max_abs_model.transform(df_vector)
```

**When to Use Each Scaling Method:**
- **StandardScaler**: When features have a Gaussian distribution and you want outliers to have less influence
- **MinMaxScaler**: When you need values in a specific range (0-1) and distribution shape is not Gaussian
- **MaxAbsScaler**: When you want to preserve zero values and handle sparse data

#### Encoding Categorical Features

**One-Hot Encoding:**

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder

# Step 1: Convert strings to indices
indexer = StringIndexer(
    inputCol="category", 
    outputCol="category_index",
    handleInvalid="keep"  # Options: "error", "skip", "keep"
)
df_indexed = indexer.fit(df).transform(df)

# Step 2: Apply one-hot encoding
encoder = OneHotEncoder(
    inputCol="category_index",
    outputCol="category_encoded"
)
df_encoded = encoder.fit(df_indexed).transform(df_indexed)
```

**Handling High-Cardinality Categorical Features:**

For features with many unique values (high cardinality), one-hot encoding can lead to too many dimensions. Alternatives include:

```python
# 1. Target encoding (average of target by category)
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import avg, col

# For binary classification
window_spec = Window.partitionBy("category")
df = df.withColumn(
    "category_target_encoded",
    avg("target").over(window_spec)
)

# 2. Frequency encoding (replace category with its frequency)
category_freq = df.groupBy("category").count()
df = df.join(category_freq, "category")
df = df.withColumn("category_freq_encoded", col("count") / df.count())
df = df.drop("count")

# 3. Hash encoding (for extremely high cardinality)
from pyspark.ml.feature import FeatureHasher
hasher = FeatureHasher(
    inputCols=["category"],
    outputCol="category_hashed",
    numFeatures=50  # Number of buckets
)
df_hashed = hasher.transform(df)
```

#### Feature Selection

Feature selection reduces dimensionality by selecting the most important features:

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorSlicer, ChiSqSelector
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression

# Method 1: Using model-based feature importance
lr = LinearRegression(featuresCol="features_vector", labelCol="target")
lr_model = lr.fit(df_vector)

# Extract feature importance
import pandas as pd
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': numeric_cols,
    'Importance': [abs(coef) for coef in lr_model.coefficients]
})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('Importance', ascending=False)
display(feature_importance)

# Method 2: Chi-square selector (for classification)
selector = ChiSqSelector(
    numTopFeatures=5,
    featuresCol="features_vector",
    outputCol="selected_features",
    labelCol="target"
)
selector_model = selector.fit(df_vector)
df_selected = selector_model.transform(df_vector)
```

### 6. Building ML Pipelines in Databricks

#### Spark ML Pipeline Concept

Pipelines chain multiple transformations and models into a single workflow, ensuring:
- Consistent application of transformations to training and test data
- Easier experiment tracking and reproducibility
- Simplified model deployment

#### Creating a Pipeline

```python
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder, VectorAssembler, StandardScaler
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression

# Define stages
# 1. Index categorical columns
categoricalCols = ["state", "gender", "occupation"]
indexers = [StringIndexer(inputCol=c, outputCol=f"{c}_index", handleInvalid="keep") 
            for c in categoricalCols]

# 2. One-hot encode indexed categorical columns
encoders = [OneHotEncoder(inputCol=f"{c}_index", outputCol=f"{c}_encoded")
            for c in categoricalCols]

# 3. Assemble all features into a vector
numericCols = ["age", "income", "credit_score"]
assembler_inputs = [f"{c}_encoded" for c in categoricalCols] + numericCols
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=assembler_inputs, outputCol="features_unscaled")

# 4. Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol="features_unscaled", outputCol="features")

# 5. Define the model
lr = LogisticRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="target")

# Create the pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(stages=indexers + encoders + [assembler, scaler, lr])
```

#### Fitting and Using the Pipeline

```python
# Split data
train_df, test_df = df.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)

# Fit the pipeline
pipeline_model = pipeline.fit(train_df)

# Apply the fitted pipeline to test data
predictions = pipeline_model.transform(test_df)

# Evaluate results
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator
evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="target")
auc = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
print(f"AUC: {auc}")
```

#### Saving and Loading Pipelines

```python
# Save the pipeline model
pipeline_model.write().overwrite().save("/dbfs/ml/models/customer_churn_pipeline")

# Load the saved pipeline
from pyspark.ml import PipelineModel
loaded_pipeline = PipelineModel.load("/dbfs/ml/models/customer_churn_pipeline")

# Use the loaded pipeline
new_predictions = loaded_pipeline.transform(new_data)
```

---

### 7. Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning Basics

#### Cross-Validation Concept

Cross-validation helps estimate model performance more reliably by:
- Splitting data into multiple folds
- Training on k-1 folds and testing on the remaining fold
- Repeating the process for each fold
- Averaging results across all folds

#### Implementing Cross-Validation

```python
from pyspark.ml.tuning import CrossValidator, ParamGridBuilder
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator

# Create evaluator
evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(
    labelCol="target", 
    metricName="areaUnderROC"  # Options: "areaUnderROC", "areaUnderPR"
)

# Create parameter grid for hyperparameter tuning
paramGrid = ParamGridBuilder() \
    .addGrid(lr.regParam, [0.01, 0.1, 1.0]) \
    .addGrid(lr.elasticNetParam, [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]) \
    .build()

# Create k-fold cross-validator
cv = CrossValidator(
    estimator=pipeline,
    estimatorParamMaps=paramGrid,
    evaluator=evaluator,
    numFolds=5,  # Number of folds
    seed=42
)

# Execute cross-validation and choose the best model
cv_model = cv.fit(train_df)

# Access the best model
best_model = cv_model.bestModel

# Make predictions using the best model
predictions = best_model.transform(test_df)
```

#### Hyperparameter Tuning Strategies

**Grid Search:**

```python
# Exhaustive search over specified parameter values
# Already demonstrated in the cross-validation example
```

**Random Search:**

In Spark ML, random search isn't built-in, but can be implemented by randomly sampling from the parameter space:

```python
import random
from pyspark.ml.tuning import TrainValidationSplit

# Generate random parameter combinations
num_combinations = 10
reg_params = [random.uniform(0.001, 1.0) for _ in range(num_combinations)]
elastic_net_params = [random.uniform(0.0, 1.0) for _ in range(num_combinations)]

# Create parameter grid with random combinations
random_param_grid = [
    {lr.regParam: reg_param, lr.elasticNetParam: elastic_param}
    for reg_param, elastic_param in zip(reg_params, elastic_net_params)
]

# Use TrainValidationSplit with random parameter grid
tvs = TrainValidationSplit(
    estimator=pipeline,
    estimatorParamMaps=random_param_grid,
    evaluator=evaluator,
    trainRatio=0.8
)

tvs_model = tvs.fit(train_df)
```

**Bayesian Optimization:**

For Bayesian optimization, Databricks recommends using Hyperopt, which we'll cover in more detail on Day 3.

**Objective:** Build a complete ML pipeline that performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training for a customer churn prediction problem.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   ```python
   # Load the dataset
   df = spark.table("default.telco_customer_churn")
   
   # Explore data
   display(df.limit(5))
   print(f"Total rows: {df.count()}")
   print(f"Total columns: {len(df.columns)}")
   
   # Check schema
   df.printSchema()
   
   # Summary statistics
   display(df.summary())
   
   # Check for missing values
   from pyspark.sql.functions import col, when, count, isnan
   missing_values = df.select([count(when(col(c).isNull() | isnan(col(c)), c)).alias(c) for c in df.columns])

   df = df.withColumn("MonthlyCharges", col("MonthlyCharges").cast("double"))
   df = df.withColumn("TotalCharges", col("TotalCharges").cast("double"))
   
   # Handle missing values in TotalCharges
   df = df.withColumn(
       "TotalCharges",
       when(col("TotalCharges").isNull(), col("MonthlyCharges") * col("tenure"))
       .otherwise(col("TotalCharges"))
   )
   
   # Convert target to numeric
   df = df.withColumn("label", when(col("Churn") == "Yes", 1.0).otherwise(0.0))

       for col in categorical_cols
   ]
   
   # 3. Assemble features into a single vector
   assembler_inputs = [f"{col}_encoded" for col in categorical_cols] + numeric_cols

       .addGrid(lr.elasticNetParam, [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]) \
       .build()
   
   # Create evaluator
   evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(
       labelCol="label", 
       metricName="areaUnderROC"
   )
   
   # Create cross-validator
   cv = CrossValidator(
       estimator=pipeline,
       estimatorParamMaps=paramGrid,
       evaluator=evaluator,
       numFolds=3
   )
   
   # Train the model using cross-validation
   print("Training model with cross-validation...")
   cv_model = cv.fit(train_df)

   metrics = ["accuracy", "weightedPrecision", "weightedRecall", "f1"]
   
   for metric in metrics:
       result = multi_evaluator.setMetricName(metric).evaluate(predictions)
       print(f"{metric}: {result}")
   
   # Confusion matrix
   from pyspark.sql.functions import expr

## Spark ML & Model Training

### 1. Understanding Spark ML Architecture and Components

#### Apache Spark ML Overview

Apache Spark ML is a unified machine learning library designed for distributed computing. It provides a high-level API built on top of DataFrames that helps you create and tune practical machine learning pipelines. Spark ML offers several advantages over traditional single-node ML frameworks:

- Distributed processing for large datasets
- Seamless integration with Spark's data processing capabilities
- Consistent API for different ML algorithms
- Pipeline architecture for end-to-end workflows

#### ML Architecture Components

The Spark ML architecture consists of several key components that work together:

**DataFrame-Based API**: Unlike the older RDD-based MLlib, Spark ML operates on DataFrames, which provide a more intuitive structure for ML workflows.

**Pipeline API**: Enables connecting multiple algorithms and data transformations into a single workflow that can be treated as a unit.

**Parameter Handling**: Consistent approach to algorithm parameterization using ParamMaps.

**Persistence Layer**: Allows saving and loading models and pipelines.

**Distributed Matrix Operations**: Optimized for large-scale linear algebra.

#### ML Package Structure

The Spark ML library (`org.apache.spark.ml` in Scala, `pyspark.ml` in Python) is organized into several subpackages:

```
pyspark.ml
â”œâ”€â”€ classification (LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ clustering (KMeans, LDA, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ evaluation (BinaryClassificationEvaluator, RegressionEvaluator, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ feature (StandardScaler, PCA, StringIndexer, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ recommendation (ALS)
â”œâ”€â”€ regression (LinearRegression, GBTRegressor, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ tuning (CrossValidator, TrainValidationSplit, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ Pipeline, PipelineModel, Estimator, Transformer, etc.
```

### 2. Distinguishing between Estimators and Transformers

#### Transformers

Transformers implement a `transform()` method that converts one DataFrame into another by appending one or more columns.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Cannot be trained; they simply apply a transformation
- Always implemented as stateless operations
- Often used for feature engineering

**Common Examples:**
- `Tokenizer`: Splits text into words
- `VectorAssembler`: Combines multiple columns into a vector
- `SQLTransformer`: Applies SQL transformations

**Example Usage:**
```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import Tokenizer

# Create a transformer
tokenizer = Tokenizer(inputCol="text", outputCol="words")

# Apply the transformer
transformed_df = tokenizer.transform(df)
```

#### Estimators

Estimators implement a `fit()` method that trains a model on data and produces a Transformer (the model).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Must be trained on data before they can transform new data
- Implement a statistical algorithm or machine learning method
- Produce a model (Transformer) that can be used to make predictions

**Common Examples:**
- `LogisticRegression`: Produces a logistic regression model
- `StringIndexer`: Learns string-to-index mappings from data
- `StandardScaler`: Learns mean and standard deviation from data

**Example Usage:**
```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import StandardScaler

# Create an estimator
scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol="features", outputCol="scaled_features")

# Fit the estimator to produce a transformer (model)
scaler_model = scaler.fit(df)

# Use the transformer
scaled_df = scaler_model.transform(df)
```

#### Distinguishing Between Them

|   | Estimator | Transformer |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| Main Method | `fit()` | `transform()` |
| Returns | A Transformer (model) | A transformed DataFrame |
| Stateful | Yes (learns from data) | No |
| Example | `LogisticRegression()` | `LogisticRegressionModel` (result of fitting) |

**Conceptual Relationship:**
```
Estimator.fit(DataFrame) â†’ Transformer
Transformer.transform(DataFrame) â†’ DataFrame
```

### 3. Building and Evaluating Classification Models

#### Types of Classification Problems

**Binary Classification**: Predicting one of two classes (e.g., spam/not spam)

**Multiclass Classification**: Predicting one of multiple classes (e.g., digit recognition)

)

# Calculate AUC
auc = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
print(f"AUC: {auc}")

# Confusion matrix
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

confusion_matrix = predictions.select("label", "prediction").groupBy("label").pivot("prediction").count().fillna(0)
display(confusion_matrix)
```

**Multiclass Classification Evaluation:**
```python
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator

# Create evaluator
evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(
    labelCol="label",
    predictionCol="prediction",
    metricName="accuracy"  # Options: "f1", "weightedPrecision", "weightedRecall", "accuracy"
)

### 5. Advanced Model Tuning with Hyperopt

#### Introduction to Hyperopt

Hyperopt is a Python library for hyperparameter optimization that is well-integrated with Databricks. It provides more advanced tuning capabilities than Spark ML's built-in grid search:

- Bayesian optimization using Tree-of-Parzen-Estimators (TPE)
- Random search
- Distributed tuning with SparkTrials
- Support for complex search spaces

#### Setting Up Hyperopt for Model Tuning

```python
import mlflow
import numpy as np
from hyperopt import fmin, tpe, hp, SparkTrials, STATUS_OK, Trials

# Define the objective function
def objective(params):
    # 1. Extract parameters
    max_depth = int(params["max_depth"])
    n_estimators = int(params["n_estimators"])
    learning_rate = params["learning_rate"]
    
    # 2. Build the model with these parameters
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
    model = GradientBoostingRegressor(
        max_depth=max_depth,
        n_estimators=n_estimators,
        learning_rate=learning_rate,
        random_state=42
    )
    
    # 3. Train and evaluate the model (using cross-validation)
    from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=3, scoring="neg_mean_squared_error")
    rmse = np.sqrt(-scores.mean())
    
    # 4. Log the model with MLflow
    with mlflow.start_run(nested=True):
        mlflow.log_params({
            "max_depth": max_depth,
            "n_estimators": n_estimators,
            "learning_rate": learning_rate
        })
        mlflow.log_metric("rmse", rmse)
    
    # 5. Return results (Hyperopt minimizes the returned value)
    return {"loss": rmse, "status": STATUS_OK}
```

#### Defining the Search Space

Hyperopt allows you to define complex search spaces for your hyperparameters:

```python
# Define the search space
search_space = {
    "max_depth": hp.quniform("max_depth", 3, 10, 1),      # Integer values between 3 and 10
    "n_estimators": hp.quniform("n_estimators", 50, 500, 10),  # Integer values between 50 and 500, step 10
    "learning_rate": hp.loguniform("learning_rate", np.log(0.01), np.log(0.3))  # Log-uniform between 0.01 and 0.3
}
```

#### Running Hyperopt with SparkTrials for Distributed Tuning

```python
# Run the optimization with SparkTrials for distributed training
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="hyperopt_gbr"):
    spark_trials = SparkTrials(parallelism=4)  # Tune 4 models in parallel
    
    best_params = fmin(
        fn=objective,
        space=search_space,
        algo=tpe.suggest,  # Bayesian optimization using Tree-of-Parzen-Estimators
        max_evals=20,      # Maximum number of evaluations
        trials=spark_trials
    )
    
    # Log the best parameters
    mlflow.log_params(best_params)
    
    # Convert parameters to proper types
    best_params["max_depth"] = int(best_params["max_depth"])
    best_params["n_estimators"] = int(best_params["n_estimators"])
    
    print("Best parameters:", best_params)
```

#### Comparing Hyperopt Approaches

**Random Search:**
```python
from hyperopt import rand

# Use random search instead of TPE
best_params = fmin(
    fn=objective,
    space=search_space,
    algo=rand.suggest,  # Random search
    max_evals=20,
    trials=spark_trials
)
```

**Sequential vs. Parallel Tuning:**
```python
# Sequential tuning with Trials
trials = Trials()
best_params = fmin(
    fn=objective,
    space=search_space,
    algo=tpe.suggest,
    max_evals=20,
    trials=trials
)

# Parallel tuning with SparkTrials
spark_trials = SparkTrials(parallelism=4)
best_params = fmin(
    fn=objective,
    space=search_space,
    algo=tpe.suggest,
    max_evals=20,
    trials=spark_trials
)
```

### 6. Working with Pandas API on Spark

#### Introduction to Pandas API on Spark

Pandas API on Spark (previously known as Koalas) provides a Pandas-like API for PySpark DataFrame operations. It allows you to leverage the familiar Pandas syntax while working with distributed data.

Key advantages:
- Familiar Pandas syntax
- Scalability to large datasets
- Seamless integration with Spark

#### Creating Pandas on Spark DataFrames

```python
import pyspark.pandas as ps

# From a Spark DataFrame
spark_df = spark.table("customer_data")
psdf = spark_df.pandas_api()

# From pandas DataFrame
import pandas as pd
pandas_df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [4, 5, 6]})
psdf = ps.from_pandas(pandas_df)

# Directly from data
psdf = ps.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2, 3], "B": [4, 5, 6]})

# From CSV
psdf = ps.read_csv("/path/to/file.csv")
```

#### Working with Pandas API on Spark

```python
# Basic operations similar to pandas
psdf.head()
psdf.describe()
psdf.info()

# Selection and filtering
filtered = psdf[psdf["A"] > 1]
selected = psdf[["A", "B"]]

# Aggregations
grouped = psdf.groupby("A").agg({"B": "mean"})

# Plotting (creates pandas DataFrame for plotting)
psdf["A"].plot.hist()
```

#### Converting Between Pandas API and Spark DataFrames

```python
# Pandas on Spark DataFrame to Spark DataFrame
spark_df = psdf.to_spark()

# Spark DataFrame to Pandas on Spark DataFrame
psdf = spark_df.pandas_api()

# Pandas on Spark DataFrame to pandas DataFrame (caution: collects data to driver)
pandas_df = psdf.to_pandas()
```

#### Performance Considerations

```python
# Set default index type to distributed
ps.set_option("compute.default_index_type", "distributed")

# Cache intermediate results for multiple operations
psdf = psdf.spark.cache()

# Use spark.sql for complex operations
result = ps.sql("SELECT A, sum(B) FROM {psdf} GROUP BY A")
```

### 7. Understanding Pandas UDFs for Model Parallelization

#### Introduction to Pandas UDFs

Pandas UDFs (User-Defined Functions) allow you to apply pandas functions to Spark DataFrames, providing a bridge between pandas and PySpark. They're particularly useful for:

- Applying ML models in parallel
- Performing complex transformations efficiently
- Leveraging pandas/NumPy functionality within Spark

Pandas UDFs use Apache Arrow for efficient data transfer between JVM and Python processes.

#### Types of Pandas UDFs

**Scalar Function (mapInPandas):**
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf
from pyspark.sql.types import DoubleType
import pandas as pd

# Define a scalar pandas UDF
@pandas_udf(DoubleType())
def scaled_values(s: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    return (s - s.mean()) / s.std()

# Apply to a column
df = df.withColumn("scaled_features", scaled_values(df["features"]))
```

**Grouped Map Function:**
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf
from pyspark.sql.types import *

# Define the output schema
schema = StructType([
    StructField("id", IntegerType()),
    StructField("prediction", DoubleType())
])

# Define a grouped map function
@pandas_udf(schema)
def predict_group(group_pdf: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Train a model on this group
    X = group_pdf[['feature1', 'feature2']]
    y = group_pdf['target']
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10)
    model.fit(X, y)
    
    # Make predictions
    group_pdf['prediction'] = model.predict(X)
    return group_pdf[['id', 'prediction']]

# Apply to grouped data
result = df.groupBy("category").apply(predict_group)
```

**Iterator of Pandas UDFs (mapInPandas):**
```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf
import pandas as pd

def predict_batch(batch_iter):
    for batch in batch_iter:
        # Prepare features
        features = batch[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
        
        # Apply model (pre-trained)
        batch['prediction'] = model.predict(features)
        
        # Return the batch with predictions
        yield batch[['id', 'prediction']]

# Apply function to DataFrame
predictions = df.mapInPandas(predict_batch, schema="id long, prediction double")
```

#### Distributed Inference with Pandas UDFs

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd
from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf
from pyspark.sql.types import DoubleType

# Load a pre-trained model
loaded_model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model("runs:/my-run-id/model")

# Broadcast the model to all workers
broadcast_model = sc.broadcast(loaded_model)

# Define UDF for batch prediction
@pandas_udf(DoubleType())
def predict_udf(features_series: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    # Access the broadcasted model
    model = broadcast_model.value
    
    # Convert each row from Vector to numpy array
    features_array = np.stack(features_series.map(lambda x: x.toArray()))
    
    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(features_array)
    return pd.Series(predictions)

# Apply the UDF to make predictions
predictions = df.withColumn("prediction", predict_udf(df["features"]))
```

#### Training Per-Group Models with Pandas UDFs

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf
from pyspark.sql.types import *
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Define schema for output
schema = StructType([
    StructField("group", StringType()),
    StructField("rmse", DoubleType()),
    StructField("r2", DoubleType()),
    StructField("model_info", StringType())
])

# Define UDF to train a model per group
@pandas_udf(schema)
def train_group_model(group_pdf: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Extract group name
    group_name = group_pdf["group"].iloc[0]
    
    # Prepare features and target
    X = group_pdf[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
    y = group_pdf['target']
    
    # Train model for this group
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X, y)
    
    # Evaluate
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
    y_pred = model.predict(X)
    rmse = mean_squared_error(y, y_pred, squared=False)
    r2 = r2_score(y, y_pred)
    
    # Create output DataFrame
    result = pd.DataFrame({
        "group": [group_name],
        "rmse": [rmse],
        "r2": [r2],
        "model_info": [str(model.get_params())]
    })
    
    return result

# Apply to data grouped by 'group' column
model_metrics = df.groupBy("group").apply(train_group_model)
```

### Hands-on Lab: Hyperparameter Tuning with Hyperopt

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model with hyperparameter tuning using Hyperopt and Spark ML.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
   ```python
   # Load dataset
   df = spark.table("default.airbnb_listings")
   
   # Inspect data
   display(df.limit(5))
   
   # Select features and target
   from pyspark.sql.functions import col

   categorical_cols = ["room_type", "property_type", "bed_type"]
   numeric_cols = ["accommodates", "bathrooms", "bedrooms", "beds", "minimum_nights"]
   
   # Target column
   target_col = "price"
   
   # Prepare data
   from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder, VectorAssembler, StandardScaler
   
   # 1. Convert categorical columns to indices
   indexers = [StringIndexer(inputCol=c, outputCol=f"{c}_index", handleInvalid="keep") 
               for c in categorical_cols]
   
   # 2. One-hot encode indexed columns
   encoders = [OneHotEncoder(inputCol=f"{c}_index", outputCol=f"{c}_encoded") 
               for c in categorical_cols]
   
   # 3. Assemble features
   assembler_inputs = [f"{c}_encoded" for c in categorical_cols] + numeric_cols
   assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=assembler_inputs, outputCol="features_unscaled")
   
   # 4. Scale features
   scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol="features_unscaled", outputCol="features")
   
   # Split data into train, validation, and test
   train_df, val_df, test_df = df.randomSplit([0.7, 0.15, 0.15], seed=42)
   ```

2. **Create a Base Pipeline:**
   ```python
   from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
   from pyspark.ml.regression import GBTRegressor
   
   # Create the base regressor
   gbr = GBTRegressor(featuresCol="features", labelCol=target_col)
   
   # Create the pipeline
   pipeline = Pipeline(stages=indexers + encoders + [assembler, scaler, gbr])
   ```

3. **Define the Hyperopt Objective Function:**
   ```python
   import mlflow
   import numpy as np
   from hyperopt import STATUS_OK
   from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator
   
   def objective(params):
       # 1. Extract parameters
       max_depth = int(params["max_depth"])
       max_iter = int(params["max_iter"])
       step_size = params["step_size"]
       
       # 2. Set parameters on the model
       gbr.setMaxDepth(max_depth)
       gbr.setMaxIter(max_iter)
       gbr.setStepSize(step_size)
       
       # 3. Train the model
       with mlflow.start_run(nested=True):
           # Log parameters
           mlflow.log_params({

           })
           
           # Fit the pipeline
           pipeline_model = pipeline.fit(train_df)
           
           # Make predictions on validation set
           predictions = pipeline_model.transform(val_df)
           
           # Evaluate the model
           evaluator = RegressionEvaluator(labelCol=target_col, predictionCol="prediction", metricName="rmse")
           rmse = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
           
           # Log metrics

## Scaling ML & Advanced Topics

### 1. Distributed ML Concepts and Challenges

#### The Need for Distributed Machine Learning

Machine learning at scale presents unique challenges that traditional single-node approaches cannot efficiently address. As data volumes grow, distributed processing becomes essential for several reasons:

**Performance Limitations:**
When datasets exceed memory capacity or computational capabilities of a single machine, distributed processing allows us to divide work across multiple nodes. This is particularly important for iterative algorithms common in machine learning.

**Training Time Constraints:**
Training complex models on large datasets can take days or weeks on a single machine. Distributed processing can significantly reduce training time, enabling faster experimentation and deployment.

**Real-time Requirements:**
Many ML applications need to process streaming data and make predictions in real-time, requiring horizontal scaling across multiple machines to handle high throughput.

#### Key Distributed ML Challenges

**Data Partitioning:**
Distributing data across nodes requires careful consideration to ensure balanced workloads and minimize data transfer. Poor partitioning can lead to skewed processing times and inefficient resource utilization.

```python
# Example of controlling partitioning in Spark
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# Repartition by a key column for better distribution
df_balanced = df.repartition(200, "customer_id")

# Repartition by range for better locality with sorted data
df_range = df.repartitionByRange(200, "timestamp")
```

**Communication Overhead:**
ML algorithms often require information exchange between nodes, creating network overhead that can become a bottleneck.

**Algorithm Parallelization:**
Not all algorithms parallelize easily. Some require substantial redesign to work efficiently in a distributed environment.

**Synchronization:**
Coordinating updates across multiple nodes introduces complexity, especially for iterative algorithms that require global state.

**Resource Management:**
Efficiently allocating CPU, memory, and network resources across a cluster requires careful tuning and monitoring.

#### Distributed ML Paradigms

**Data Parallelism:**
The same model is replicated across multiple nodes, each processing a different subset of data. Results are then combined.

```python
# Data parallelism example in Spark ML
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression

# Spark ML automatically distributes data processing
lr = LogisticRegression(maxIter=10, regParam=0.1)
model = lr.fit(distributed_data)  # Data is distributed across the cluster
```

**Model Parallelism:**
Different parts of the model are distributed across nodes, with each node responsible for a portion of the calculations.

**Parameter Server Architecture:**
A central server maintains global parameters while worker nodes compute gradients based on data subsets. The server aggregates gradients and updates parameters.

**Ensemble Methods:**
Multiple models are trained independently and their predictions are combined, providing a naturally parallel approach.

---

### 2. Understanding Model Distribution in Spark

#### How Spark Distributes Model Training

Spark ML uses data parallelism as its primary distribution strategy. This approach works well for many algorithms but has important implementation differences based on the algorithm type.

**Distributed Optimization:**
For iterative optimization algorithms like linear and logistic regression, Spark employs techniques to distribute work while maintaining model coherence:

1. **Data Partitioning:** Input data is split across cluster nodes
2. **Local Computation:** Each node computes partial results (e.g., gradients) based on its data partition
3. **Aggregation:** Results are combined to update the global model
4. **Redistribution:** Updated model parameters are broadcast to all nodes
5. **Iteration:** The process repeats until convergence

```python
# Linear regression in Spark ML - distributed by default
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression

lr = LinearRegression(maxIter=20, regParam=0.3, elasticNetParam=0.8)
lr_model = lr.fit(training_data)
```

#### Linear Models Distribution

For linear models (LinearRegression, LogisticRegression), Spark implements distributed training through:

**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**
Spark can use mini-batch SGD where gradients are computed on data subsets and aggregated.

**L-BFGS Optimization:**
For faster convergence, Spark implements the Limited-memory Broydenâ€“Fletcherâ€“Goldfarbâ€“Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm in a distributed manner.

The implementations automatically handle:
- Gradient computation across partitions
- Parameter aggregation and synchronization
- Convergence checking

#### Tree-Based Model Distribution

Tree-based models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient-Boosted Trees use different distribution strategies:

**Decision Trees:**
1. **Feature Binning:** Data is summarized into bins to reduce memory requirements
2. **Statistics Collection:** Sufficient statistics for splits are computed locally on each node
3. **Aggregation:** Statistics are combined to find the best splits
4. **Tree Building:** The tree is built incrementally based on aggregated statistics

```python
# RandomForest with explicit configuration for distributed training
from pyspark.ml.classification import RandomForestClassifier

rf = RandomForestClassifier(
    numTrees=100,
    maxDepth=10,
    maxBins=32,  # Controls feature binning - important for distributed performance
    minInstancesPerNode=10  # Prevents overfitting on distributed data
)
rf_model = rf.fit(training_data)
```

**Ensemble Models:**
For ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted Trees, Spark adds another layer of parallelism:

1. **Tree Parallelism:** Different trees can be built independently in parallel
2. **Split Evaluation Parallelism:** Different split candidates can be evaluated in parallel

#### Clustering Algorithm Distribution

For clustering algorithms like K-means, Spark uses an iterative approach:

1. **Initialization:** Cluster centers are initialized and broadcast to all nodes
2. **Assignment:** Each node assigns its data points to the nearest center
3. **Update:** New cluster centers are computed based on aggregated point assignments
4. **Iteration:** The process repeats until convergence

```python
# K-means with explicit iterations and tolerance settings
from pyspark.ml.clustering import KMeans

kmeans = KMeans(k=5, maxIter=20, tol=1e-4)
model = kmeans.fit(features_df)
```

---

### 3. Ensemble Methods in Distributed Environments

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to achieve better predictive performance. They are particularly well-suited for distributed environments because individual models can often be trained independently.

#### Types of Ensemble Methods

**Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):**
Multiple models are trained on different random subsets of the training data, with replacement. Predictions are combined through averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification).

```python
# RandomForest in Spark ML (an example of bagging)
from pyspark.ml.classification import RandomForestClassifier

rf = RandomForestClassifier(
    numTrees=100,  # Number of trees in the forest
    featureSubsetStrategy="auto",  # Number of features to consider for each split
    subsamplingRate=0.8  # Fraction of data used for training each tree
)
model = rf.fit(training_data)
```

**Boosting:**
Models are trained sequentially, with each model trying to correct errors made by the previous ones. Examples include Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost.

```python
# GBTClassifier in Spark ML (an example of boosting)
from pyspark.ml.classification import GBTClassifier

gbt = GBTClassifier(
    maxIter=100,  # Number of boosting iterations
    maxDepth=5,  # Maximum depth of each tree
    stepSize=0.1  # Learning rate
)
model = gbt.fit(training_data)
```

**Stacking:**
Multiple models are combined using another model (meta-learner) that is trained on their outputs.

#### Distributed Implementation of Ensemble Methods

**Parallel Training:**
For methods like Random Forest, multiple trees can be trained in parallel on different nodes:

```python
# Configure Spark to utilize parallelism for RandomForest
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 200)  # Control parallelism level

rf = RandomForestClassifier(
    numTrees=500,  # More trees can leverage more parallelism
    maxDepth=10
)
```

**Sequential Training with Parallelized Steps:**
For methods like Gradient Boosting that are inherently sequential, Spark parallelizes each boosting iteration:

1. The current model state is broadcast to all nodes
2. Each node computes gradients for its data partition
3. Gradient statistics are aggregated to build the next tree
4. The process repeats for each boosting iteration

**Hyperparameter Tuning of Ensembles:**
When tuning ensemble models, we can parallelize across hyperparameter combinations:

```python
# Distributed hyperparameter tuning of RandomForest
from pyspark.ml.tuning import CrossValidator, ParamGridBuilder

paramGrid = ParamGridBuilder() \
    .addGrid(rf.numTrees, [50, 100, 200]) \
    .addGrid(rf.maxDepth, [5, 10, 15]) \
    .build()

cv = CrossValidator(
    estimator=rf,
    estimatorParamMaps=paramGrid,
    evaluator=evaluator,
    parallelism=9  # Tune up to 9 combinations in parallel
)
```

#### Performance Considerations for Distributed Ensembles

**Memory Usage:**
Ensemble methods can be memory-intensive since multiple models are maintained:

```python
# Control memory usage for large ensembles
rf = RandomForestClassifier(
    numTrees=100,
    maxMemoryInMB=256,  # Limit memory per node
    cacheNodeIds=False  # Reduce memory usage
)
```

**Communication Overhead:**
Trees in Random Forest can be trained independently with minimal communication. In contrast, boosting methods require more synchronization between iterations.

**Prediction Latency:**
Ensembles require evaluating multiple models, which can increase prediction time:

```python
# For faster predictions with RandomForest
rf = RandomForestClassifier(
    numTrees=100,
    maxDepth=8  # Shallower trees for faster prediction
)
```

---

### 4. Scaling Considerations for Large Datasets

#### Data Management Strategies

**Efficient Storage Formats:**
Choose appropriate file formats for large-scale ML:

```python
# Save data in Parquet format for efficient access
df.write.format("parquet").save("/path/to/data")

# Read efficiently with partitioning
df = spark.read.parquet("/path/to/data")
```

**Partitioning Strategies:**
Properly partition data to enable efficient parallel processing and minimize data shuffling:

```python
# Partition data by a frequently filtered column
df.write.partitionBy("date").format("parquet").save("/path/to/partitioned_data")

# Read specific partitions
df_subset = spark.read.parquet("/path/to/partitioned_data/date=2023-01-*")
```

**Caching:**
Strategically cache datasets that are used repeatedly:

```python
# Cache processed features for multiple iterations
processed_features = pipeline.fit(raw_data).transform(raw_data)
processed_features.cache()

# Use the cached data for multiple models
model1 = RandomForestClassifier().fit(processed_features)
model2 = GBTClassifier().fit(processed_features)

# Release memory when done
processed_features.unpersist()
```

#### Computational Optimization

**Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction:**
Reduce computational load by working with fewer features:

```python
from pyspark.ml.feature import PCA

# Reduce dimensions with PCA
pca = PCA(k=20, inputCol="features", outputCol="pca_features")
reduced_data = pca.fit(data).transform(data)
```

**MiniBatch Processing:**
For algorithms that support it, use mini-batch processing to handle large datasets efficiently:

```python
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression

# Configure mini-batch size for optimization
lr = LogisticRegression(
    maxIter=100,
    regParam=0.01,
    miniBatchFraction=0.1  # Process 10% of data per iteration
)
```

**Checkpoint Intermediate Results:**
For iterative algorithms, checkpointing can prevent recomputation and reduce memory pressure:

```python
# Enable checkpointing
sc.setCheckpointDir("/path/to/checkpoint/dir")

# Checkpoint a DataFrame to avoid recomputation of ancestry
intermediate_result = heavy_computation(input_data)
intermediate_result.checkpoint()
result = further_processing(intermediate_result)
```

#### Cluster Resource Management

**Right-sizing Clusters:**
Scale your cluster based on the workload requirements:

```python
# For Databricks clusters, you can configure autoscaling
# through the UI or programmatically with the Clusters API
```

**Worker Configuration:**
Optimize worker configuration for ML workloads:

```python
# Set executor memory
spark.conf.set("spark.executor.memory", "16g")

# Set executor cores
spark.conf.set("spark.executor.cores", "4")

# Set number of partitions for better parallelism
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "400")
```

**Memory Management:**
Adjust memory allocation to prevent out-of-memory errors:

```python
# Increase memory fraction for caching
spark.conf.set("spark.memory.fraction", "0.8")

# Reserve more memory for aggregations
spark.conf.set("spark.memory.storageFraction", "0.3")
```

#### Monitoring and Debugging

**Track Performance Metrics:**
Monitor cluster and job performance to identify bottlenecks:

```python
# Use Spark UI to monitor job stages and task metrics
# In Databricks, this is available through the Spark UI tab
```

**Understand Data Skew:**
Identify and address data skew that can cause certain partitions to process disproportionately large amounts of data:

```python
# Inspect partition sizes
df.groupBy(F.spark_partition_id()).count().orderBy("count", ascending=False).show()

# Re-partition to address skew
df_balanced = df.repartition(200, "key_column")
```

### 5. End-to-end ML Workflow Implementation

An end-to-end machine learning workflow in a production environment involves multiple stages, from data ingestion to model serving. Let's explore how to implement such a workflow in Databricks.

#### Data Ingestion and Validation

The first step is to reliably ingest data and validate its quality:

```python
# Load data from various sources
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, isnan, when, count

# Load data
raw_data = spark.read.format("delta").table("bronze.user_interactions")

# Validate data quality
data_quality_report = {
    "row_count": raw_data.count(),
    "column_count": len(raw_data.columns),
    "missing_values": {}
}

# Check for missing values
for column in raw_data.columns:
    missing_count = raw_data.filter(col(column).isNull() | isnan(col(column))).count()
    missing_percentage = (missing_count / data_quality_report["row_count"]) * 100
    data_quality_report["missing_values"][column] = f"{missing_percentage:.2f}%"

# Validate data types
schema_issues = []
for field in raw_data.schema.fields:
    sample_nulls = raw_data.filter(col(field.name).isNull()).count()
    sample_non_nulls = raw_data.filter(col(field.name).isNotNull()).limit(100).collect()
    
    # Check for type mismatches
    if sample_non_nulls:
        for row in sample_non_nulls:
            try:
                value = row[field.name]
                if value is not None and not isinstance(value, field.dataType.pythonType):
                    schema_issues.append(f"Type mismatch in {field.name}: expected {field.dataType}, got {type(value)}")
                    break
            except:
                schema_issues.append(f"Error checking type for {field.name}")
                break
```

#### Feature Engineering Pipeline

Create a robust feature engineering pipeline that can be reused for both training and inference:

```python
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder, VectorAssembler, StandardScaler, Imputer

# Define feature engineering steps

# 1. Impute missing values
numeric_cols = ["age", "tenure", "balance"]
categorical_cols = ["job", "marital", "education", "default", "housing", "loan", "contact", "month", "poutcome"]

imputer = Imputer(
    inputCols=numeric_cols,
    outputCols=[f"{c}_imputed" for c in numeric_cols],
    strategy="mean"
)

# 2. Index categorical features
indexers = [
    StringIndexer(inputCol=c, outputCol=f"{c}_indexed", handleInvalid="keep")
    for c in categorical_cols
]

# 3. One-hot encode categorical features
encoders = [
    OneHotEncoder(inputCol=f"{c}_indexed", outputCol=f"{c}_encoded")
    for c in categorical_cols
]

# 4. Assemble features into a single vector
imputed_cols = [f"{c}_imputed" for c in numeric_cols]
encoded_cols = [f"{c}_encoded" for c in categorical_cols]

assembler = VectorAssembler(
    inputCols=imputed_cols + encoded_cols,
    outputCol="assembled_features"
)

# 5. Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler(
    inputCol="assembled_features",
    outputCol="features",
    withMean=True,
    withStd=True
)

# Create a pipeline for feature engineering
feature_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[
    imputer,
    *indexers,
    *encoders,
    assembler,
    scaler
])
```

#### Model Training with MLflow Tracking

Train models while tracking experiments with MLflow:

```python
import mlflow
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, GBTClassifier
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator, MulticlassClassificationEvaluator
from pyspark.ml.tuning import CrossValidator, ParamGridBuilder

# Split data into training and validation sets
train_data, val_data = validated_data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)

# Define evaluators
binary_evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(
    labelCol="label",
    rawPredictionCol="rawPrediction",
    metricName="areaUnderROC"
)

multi_evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(
    labelCol="label",
    predictionCol="prediction",
    metricName="accuracy"
)

# Set up experiment tracking
mlflow.set_experiment("/Users/your_user/banking_classification")

# Train multiple models with MLflow tracking
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="model_comparison"):
    # 1. Fit feature pipeline
    feature_pipeline_model = feature_pipeline.fit(train_data)
    train_features = feature_pipeline_model.transform(train_data)
    val_features = feature_pipeline_model.transform(val_data)
    
    # Log feature importance if available
    mlflow.log_param("num_features", len(train_features.select("features").first()[0]))
    
    # 2. Train Logistic Regression
    with mlflow.start_run(run_name="logistic_regression", nested=True):
        lr = LogisticRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="label", maxIter=10)
        lr_model = lr.fit(train_features)
        
        # Make predictions
        lr_predictions = lr_model.transform(val_features)
        
        # Evaluate model
        lr_auc = binary_evaluator.evaluate(lr_predictions)
        lr_accuracy = multi_evaluator.evaluate(lr_predictions)
        
        # Log parameters and metrics
        mlflow.log_params({
            "model_type": "LogisticRegression",
            "maxIter": lr.getMaxIter(),

        })
        
        # Log model
        mlflow.spark.log_model(lr_model, "model")
    
    # 3. Train Random Forest
    with mlflow.start_run(run_name="random_forest", nested=True):
        rf = RandomForestClassifier(featuresCol="features", labelCol="label", numTrees=100)
        rf_model = rf.fit(train_features)
        
        # Make predictions
        rf_predictions = rf_model.transform(val_features)
        
        # Evaluate model

        })
        
        mlflow.log_metrics({
            "auc": rf_auc,
            "accuracy": rf_accuracy
        })
        
        # Log model
        mlflow.spark.log_model(rf_model, "model")
```

#### Hyperparameter Tuning

Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance:

```python
# Hyperparameter tuning for the best model (Random Forest)
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="rf_hyperparameter_tuning"):
    # Define parameter grid
    paramGrid = ParamGridBuilder() \
        .addGrid(rf.numTrees, [50, 100, 200]) \
        .addGrid(rf.maxDepth, [5, 10, 20]) \
        .addGrid(rf.maxBins, [32, 64]) \
        .build()
    
    # Create cross-validator
    cv = CrossValidator(
        estimator=rf,
        estimatorParamMaps=paramGrid,
        evaluator=binary_evaluator,
        numFolds=3,
        parallelism=4
    )
    
    # Run cross-validation on the preprocessed training data
    cv_model = cv.fit(train_features)
    
    # Get the best model
    best_rf_model = cv_model.bestModel
    
    # Evaluate on validation set
    best_predictions = best_rf_model.transform(val_features)
    best_auc = binary_evaluator.evaluate(best_predictions)
    best_accuracy = multi_evaluator.evaluate(best_predictions)
    
    # Log best parameters and metrics
    mlflow.log_params({
        "best_numTrees": best_rf_model.getNumTrees(),
        "best_maxDepth": best_rf_model.getMaxDepth(),
        "best_maxBins": best_rf_model.getMaxBins()
    })
    
    mlflow.log_metrics({
        "best_auc": best_auc,
        "best_accuracy": best_accuracy
    })
    
    # Log best model
    mlflow.spark.log_model(
        best_rf_model,
        "best_model",
        registered_model_name="banking_classification"
    )
```

#### Model Registration and Deployment

Register the best model and prepare it for deployment:

```python
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()

# Get latest model version
model_name = "banking_classification"
latest_version = max([int(mv.version) for mv in client.search_model_versions(f"name='{model_name}'")])

# Transition model to staging
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name=model_name,
    version=latest_version,
    stage="Staging"
)

# Add model description
client.update_model_version(
    name=model_name,
    version=latest_version,
    description="Random Forest model with tuned hyperparameters"
)

# Create the complete pipeline including feature engineering
complete_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[
    *feature_pipeline.getStages(),
    best_rf_model
])

# Fit the complete pipeline on the full dataset
complete_model = complete_pipeline.fit(validated_data)

# Save the complete pipeline model for batch inference
complete_model.write().overwrite().save("/dbfs/models/banking_classification_pipeline")

# Register the complete pipeline model
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="register_complete_pipeline"):
    mlflow.spark.log_model(
        complete_model,
        "complete_pipeline",
        registered_model_name="banking_classification_pipeline"
    )
```

#### Batch Inference

Implement batch inference for generating predictions on new data:

```python
# Load the complete pipeline model
from pyspark.ml import PipelineModel

loaded_model = PipelineModel.load("/dbfs/models/banking_classification_pipeline")

# Load new data for batch inference
new_data = spark.table("bronze.new_customer_interactions")

# Generate predictions
predictions = loaded_model.transform(new_data)

# Select relevant columns
results = predictions.select(
    "customer_id",
    "interaction_date",
    "prediction",
    "probability"
)

# Save results to a table
results.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("silver.customer_predictions")
```

#### Monitoring Model Performance

Set up monitoring to track model performance over time:

```python
# Create a function to log model performance metrics
def log_model_performance(prediction_table, actual_label_table, run_date):
    """Log model performance metrics to a tracking table."""
    
    # Join predictions with actual labels
    performance_data = spark.sql(f"""
        SELECT
            p.customer_id,
            p.prediction,
            p.probability,
            a.actual_label,
            '{run_date}' as evaluation_date
        FROM
            {prediction_table} p
        JOIN
            {actual_label_table} a
        ON
            p.customer_id = a.customer_id
    """)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    from pyspark.sql.functions import when, col, sum, count
    
    metrics = performance_data.select(
        count("*").alias("total_predictions"),
        sum(when(col("prediction") == col("actual_label"), 1).otherwise(0)).alias("correct_predictions"),
        sum(when((col("prediction") == 1.0) & (col("actual_label") == 1.0), 1).otherwise(0)).alias("true_positives"),
        sum(when((col("prediction") == 1.0) & (col("actual_label") == 0.0), 1).otherwise(0)).alias("false_positives"),
        sum(when((col("prediction") == 0.0) & (col("actual_label") == 1.0), 1).otherwise(0)).alias("false_negatives"),
        sum(when((col("prediction") == 0.0) & (col("actual_label") == 0.0), 1).otherwise(0)).alias("true_negatives")
    ).first()
    
    # Calculate derived metrics
    accuracy = metrics.correct_predictions / metrics.total_predictions
    
    if (metrics.true_positives + metrics.false_positives) > 0:
        precision = metrics.true_positives / (metrics.true_positives + metrics.false_positives)
    else:
        precision = 0
        
    if (metrics.true_positives + metrics.false_negatives) > 0:
        recall = metrics.true_positives / (metrics.true_positives + metrics.false_negatives)
    else:
        recall = 0
        
    if (precision + recall) > 0:
        f1_score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
    else:
        f1_score = 0
    
    # Log to performance tracking table
    performance_metrics = spark.createDataFrame([
        (run_date, metrics.total_predictions, accuracy, precision, recall, f1_score)
    ], ["evaluation_date", "total_predictions", "accuracy", "precision", "recall", "f1_score"])
    
    performance_metrics.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable("gold.model_performance_tracking")
    
    # Report current performance
    print(f"Performance metrics for {run_date}:")
    print(f"  Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
    print(f"  Precision: {precision:.4f}")
    print(f"  Recall: {recall:.4f}")
    print(f"  F1 Score: {f1_score:.4f}")
    
    return {
        "accuracy": accuracy,
        "precision": precision,
        "recall": recall,
        "f1_score": f1_score
    }
```

### 6. Troubleshooting Common ML Pipeline Issues

Machine learning pipelines in production environments often encounter various issues. Understanding how to identify and resolve these problems is crucial for maintaining reliable systems.

#### Memory Management Issues

**Symptom: Out of Memory Errors**

**Diagnosis:**
```python
# Check the size of the DataFrame
print(f"Number of partitions: {df.rdd.getNumPartitions()}")
print(f"Number of rows: {df.count()}")
print(f"Number of columns: {len(df.columns)}")

# Estimate DataFrame size
from pyspark.sql.functions import lit, col
import sys

def estimate_size(df, n_sample=1000):
    sample_df = df.limit(n_sample)
    sample_size = sys.getsizeof(sample_df.toPandas())
    full_size_estimate = sample_size * (df.count() / n_sample)
    return full_size_estimate / (1024 * 1024)  # MB

print(f"Estimated DataFrame size: {estimate_size(df):.2f} MB")
```

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Increase memory allocation
spark.conf.set("spark.driver.memory", "16g")
spark.conf.set("spark.executor.memory", "16g")

# 2. Optimize storage with proper data types
from pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType, DoubleType, StringType

df = df.withColumn("int_col", col("int_col").cast(IntegerType()))
df = df.withColumn("double_col", col("double_col").cast(DoubleType()))

# 3. Repartition to better distribute data
df = df.repartition(100)

# 4. Process data in batches
def process_in_batches(df, batch_size=100000, process_fn=None):
    total_rows = df.count()
    num_batches = (total_rows + batch_size - 1) // batch_size
    
    results = []
    for i in range(num_batches):
        start_idx = i * batch_size
        batch = df.limit(batch_size).offset(start_idx)
        result = process_fn(batch) if process_fn else batch
        results.append(result)
    
    return results
```

#### Data Skew Issues

**Symptom: Slow-running Tasks or Uneven Task Distribution**

**Diagnosis:**
```python
# Check partition sizes
from pyspark.sql.functions import spark_partition_id

partition_counts = df.groupBy(spark_partition_id()).count().orderBy("count", ascending=False)
display(partition_counts)

# Check key distribution for a specific column
key_distribution = df.groupBy("join_key").count().orderBy("count", ascending=False)
display(key_distribution.limit(20))
```

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Salting keys for better distribution
from pyspark.sql.functions import rand, concat, lit

# Add a salt to skewed keys
num_salts = 10
df_salted = df.withColumn("salted_key", 
                           concat(col("join_key"), 
                                  lit("_"), 
                                  (rand() * num_salts).cast("int").cast("string")))

# 2. Broadcast small tables in joins
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast

result = df.join(broadcast(small_df), "join_key")

# 3. Repartition by range for better distribution
df_balanced = df.repartitionByRange(200, "join_key")
```

#### Pipeline Stage Failures

**Symptom: Pipeline Fit or Transform Fails**

**Diagnosis:**
```python
# Check for missing values in critical columns
missing_values = df.select([count(when(col(c).isNull(), c)).alias(c) for c in df.columns])
display(missing_values)

# Check for data type issues
for field in df.schema.fields:
    print(f"Column: {field.name}, Type: {field.dataType}")
    
# Verify data constraints
from pyspark.sql.functions import min, max

numeric_stats = df.select([
    min(col("num_col")).alias("min_value"),
    max(col("num_col")).alias("max_value")
])
display(numeric_stats)
```

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Add explicit error handling in pipeline stages
from pyspark.ml.feature import Imputer

# Handle missing values before problematic stages
imputer = Imputer(
    inputCols=["feature1", "feature2"],
    outputCols=["feature1_imputed", "feature2_imputed"]
)

# 2. Set handleInvalid parameter for relevant stages
indexer = StringIndexer(
    inputCol="category",
    outputCol="category_index",
    handleInvalid="keep"  # Options: "error", "skip", "keep"
)

# 3. Implement custom validation steps
def validate_pipeline_input(df, required_cols, numeric_cols, categorical_cols):
    """Validate dataframe before pipeline processing."""
    validation_errors = []
    
    # Check for required columns
    missing_cols = [col for col in required_cols if col not in df.columns]
    if missing_cols:
        validation_errors.append(f"Missing required columns: {', '.join(missing_cols)}")
    
    # Check for null values in required columns
    for col_name in required_cols:
        if col_name in df.columns:
            null_count = df.filter(col(col_name).isNull()).count()
            if null_count > 0:
                validation_errors.append(f"Column {col_name} contains {null_count} null values")
    
    # Check data types
    for col_name in numeric_cols:
        if col_name in df.columns:
            try:
                df.select(col(col_name).cast("double")).limit(1).collect()
            except:
                validation_errors.append(f"Column {col_name} cannot be cast to numeric")
    
    return validation_errors
```

#### Performance Bottlenecks

**Symptom: Slow Training or Inference**

**Diagnosis:**
```python
# Time different stages of the pipeline
import time

def time_operation(operation_name, operation_fn):
    start_time = time.time()
    result = operation_fn()
    end_time = time.time()
    
    duration = end_time - start_time
    print(f"{operation_name} took {duration:.2f} seconds")
    
    return result

# Time feature engineering
feature_data = time_operation("Feature Engineering", lambda: feature_pipeline.fit(train_data).transform(train_data))

# Time model training
model = time_operation("Model Training", lambda: rf.fit(feature_data))

# Time inference
predictions = time_operation("Inference", lambda: model.transform(feature_data))
```

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Cache intermediate results
processed_features = feature_pipeline.fit(train_data).transform(train_data)
processed_features.cache()

# Train multiple models on cached features
model1 = time_operation("Model 1 Training", lambda: lr.fit(processed_features))
model2 = time_operation("Model 2 Training", lambda: rf.fit(processed_features))

processed_features.unpersist()

# 2. Optimize feature transformations
# Use more efficient transformations
from pyspark.ml.feature import Bucketizer

# Replace fine-grained binning with bucketizer
bucketizer = Bucketizer(
    splits=[-float("inf"), 0, 10, 20, 30, float("inf")],
    inputCol="raw_feature",
    outputCol="bucketized_feature"
)

# 3. Use appropriate algorithms for the dataset size
# For large datasets, use distributed algorithms
# For smaller datasets, consider single-node algorithms with broadcast variables
```

### 7. Best Practices for ML in Production

#### Model Versioning and Governance

**Model Registry Best Practices:**
```python
import mlflow
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()

# 1. Use semantic versioning for models
model_name = "customer_churn_predictor"
model_version = 1
model_stage = "Development"  # "Development", "Staging", "Production", "Archived"

# 2. Document models thoroughly
client.update_registered_model(
    name=model_name,
    description="Customer churn prediction model using gradient boosting"
)

client.update_model_version(
    name=model_name,
    version=model_version,
    description="Trained on data from Jan-Mar 2023, includes new features for customer support interactions"
)

# 3. Tag models with relevant metadata
client.set_registered_model_tag(model_name, "team", "customer_analytics")
client.set_registered_model_tag(model_name, "use_case", "churn_prediction")

client.set_model_version_tag(model_name, model_version, "training_dataset", "customer_data_q1_2023")
client.set_model_version_tag(model_name, model_version, "feature_count", "42")
```

**Model Testing and Validation:**
```python
# Define model validation criteria
def validate_model(model, validation_data, baseline_metrics):
    """Validate model against defined criteria before promotion."""
    
    # Generate predictions
    predictions = model.transform(validation_data)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="label", metricName="areaUnderROC")
    auc = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
    
    multi_evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="label", predictionCol="prediction")
    
    accuracy = multi_evaluator.setMetricName("accuracy").evaluate(predictions)
    f1 = multi_evaluator.setMetricName("f1").evaluate(predictions)
    
    # Check against thresholds
    validation_results = {
        "passed": True,
        "metrics": {
            "auc": auc,
            "accuracy": accuracy,
            "f1": f1
        },
        "warnings": []
    }
    
    # Validation rules
    if auc < baseline_metrics["min_auc"]:
        validation_results["passed"] = False
        validation_results["warnings"].append(f"AUC {auc:.4f} below threshold {baseline_metrics['min_auc']:.4f}")
    
    if accuracy < baseline_metrics["min_accuracy"]:
        validation_results["passed"] = False
        validation_results["warnings"].append(f"Accuracy {accuracy:.4f} below threshold {baseline_metrics['min_accuracy']:.4f}")
    
    if f1 < baseline_metrics["min_f1"]:
        validation_results["passed"] = False
        validation_results["warnings"].append(f"F1 {f1:.4f} below threshold {baseline_metrics['min_f1']:.4f}")
    
    return validation_results
```

**Model Promotion Workflow:**
```python
def promote_model(model_name, version, target_stage, validation_data, baseline_metrics):
    """Promote a model through stages with validation."""
    
    client = MlflowClient()
    
    # 1. Load the model version
    model_uri = f"models:/{model_name}/{version}"
    model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(model_uri)
    
    # 2. Validate the model
    validation_results = validate_model(model, validation_data, baseline_metrics)
    
    # 3. Promote if validation passes
    if validation_results["passed"]:
        client.transition_model_version_stage(
            name=model_name,
            version=version,
            stage=target_stage
        )
        
        # Log promotion
        print(f"Model {model_name} version {version} promoted to {target_stage}")
        print(f"Metrics: {validation_results['metrics']}")
        
        return True, validation_results
    else:
        # Log validation failure
        print(f"Model {model_name} version {version} failed validation for {target_stage}")
        print(f"Metrics: {validation_results['metrics']}")
        print(f"Warnings: {validation_results['warnings']}")
        
        return False, validation_results
```

#### Continuous Training and Monitoring

**Automated Retraining Pipeline:**
```python
def automated_retraining(
    current_model_name,
    current_model_version,
    training_data_table,
    feature_columns,
    label_column,

):
    """Automated retraining pipeline that evaluates if a new model should replace current model."""
    
    # 1. Fetch current model metrics
    client = MlflowClient()

    current_run_id = current_model_info.run_id
    current_metrics = client.get_run(current_run_id).data.metrics
    
    # 2. Load and prepare new training data
    new_data = spark.table(training_data_table)
    train_data, val_data = new_data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)

### 8. Hands-on Lab: Building a Scalable ML Solution

**Objective:** Build an end-to-end scalable machine learning solution for a large dataset that includes data processing, model training with distributed algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.

**Dataset:** We'll use a large customer transaction dataset to predict customer churn.

**Steps:**

1. **Set Up the Environment:**
   ```python
   # Configure Spark for ML workloads
   spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "200")
   spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
   spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled", "true")
   
   # Set up MLflow experiment
   import mlflow
   mlflow.set_experiment("/Users/your_user/scalable_churn_prediction")
   ```

2. **Load and Explore Data:**
   ```python
   # Load data
   transactions = spark.read.table("bronze.customer_transactions")
   profiles = spark.read.table("bronze.customer_profiles")
   
   # Display data info
   print(f"Transactions: {transactions.count()} rows, {len(transactions.columns)} columns")
   print(f"Profiles: {profiles.count()} rows, {len(profiles.columns)} columns")
   
   # Sample data
   display(transactions.limit(5))
   display(profiles.limit(5))
   
   # Check for missing values
   from pyspark.sql.functions import col, count, when, isnan
   
   def check_missing(df, name):
       print(f"Missing values in {name}:")
       missing = df.select([count(when(col(c).isNull() | isnan(col(c)), c)).alias(c) for c in df.columns])
       return missing
   
   display(check_missing(transactions, "transactions"))
   display(check_missing(profiles, "profiles"))
   ```

3. **Feature Engineering at Scale:**
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, avg, count, datediff, current_date
   
   # Join datasets
   df = profiles.join(transactions, "customer_id", "left")
   
   # Aggregate transaction features
   agg_features = transactions.groupBy("customer_id").agg(
       count("transaction_id").alias("transaction_count"),
       sum("amount").alias("total_spend"),
       avg("amount").alias("avg_transaction_value"),
       datediff(current_date(), max("transaction_date")).alias("days_since_last_transaction")
   )
   
   # Join aggregated features
   customer_features = profiles.join(agg_features, "customer_id", "left")
   
   # Handle missing values
   from pyspark.sql.functions import lit, coalesce
   
   # Fill missing aggregated values with appropriate defaults
   customer_features = customer_features.withColumn(
       "transaction_count", 
       coalesce(col("transaction_count"), lit(0))
   ).withColumn(
       "total_spend", 
       coalesce(col("total_spend"), lit(0))
   ).withColumn(
       "avg_transaction_value", 
       coalesce(col("avg_transaction_value"), lit(0))
   ).withColumn(
       "days_since_last_transaction", 
       coalesce(col("days_since_last_transaction"), lit(365))
   )
   
   # Feature derivation
   customer_features = customer_features.withColumn(
       "is_active", 
       when(col("days_since_last_transaction") <= 90, 1).otherwise(0)
   )
   
   # Cache the feature dataframe to speed up subsequent operations
   customer_features.cache()
   
   # Create label column for churn prediction (churn = no transaction in the last 90 days)
   customer_features = customer_features.withColumn(
       "churn", 
       when(col("days_since_last_transaction") > 90, 1.0).otherwise(0.0)
   )
   ```

4. **Build ML Pipeline:**
   ```python
   from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
   from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder, VectorAssembler, StandardScaler
   
   # Define categorical and numeric columns
   categorical_cols = ["gender", "state", "subscription_type"]
   numeric_cols = ["age", "tenure_months", "transaction_count", "total_spend", 
                   "avg_transaction_value", "days_since_last_transaction"]
   
   # Set up pipeline stages
   # 1. Index categorical columns
   indexers = [StringIndexer(inputCol=c, outputCol=f"{c}_idx", handleInvalid="keep") 
               for c in categorical_cols]
   
   # 2. One-hot encode indexed columns
   encoders = [OneHotEncoder(inputCol=f"{c}_idx", outputCol=f"{c}_enc") 
               for c in categorical_cols]
   
   # 3. Assemble features
   encoded_cols = [f"{c}_enc" for c in categorical_cols]
   assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=encoded_cols + numeric_cols, outputCol="features_raw")
   
   # 4. Scale features
   scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol="features_raw", outputCol="features")
   
   # Create a preprocessing pipeline
   preprocessing_stages = indexers + encoders + [assembler, scaler]
   preprocessing = Pipeline(stages=preprocessing_stages)
   ```

5. **Distributed Model Training:**
   ```python
   from pyspark.ml.classification import RandomForestClassifier, GBTClassifier
   
   # Split data
   train, val, test = customer_features.randomSplit([0.7, 0.15, 0.15], seed=42)
   
   # Fit preprocessing pipeline
   preprocessing_model = preprocessing.fit(train)
   
   # Apply preprocessing
   train_processed = preprocessing_model.transform(train)
   val_processed = preprocessing_model.transform(val)
   
   # Train Random Forest model
   rf = RandomForestClassifier(
       featuresCol="features",
       labelCol="churn",
       numTrees=100,
       maxDepth=10,
       maxBins=64,
       seed=42
   )
   
   with mlflow.start_run(run_name="rf_initial"):
       # Log parameters
       mlflow.log_params({
           "numTrees": rf.getNumTrees(),
           "maxDepth": rf.getMaxDepth(),
           "maxBins": rf.getMaxBins()
       })
       
       # Train model
       rf_model = rf.fit(train_processed)
       
       # Evaluate
       from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator, MulticlassClassificationEvaluator
       
       # Make predictions
       val_predictions = rf_model.transform(val_processed)
       
       # Evaluate with different metrics
       binary_evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="churn", metricName="areaUnderROC")
       multi_evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="churn", predictionCol="prediction")
       
       auc = binary_evaluator.evaluate(val_predictions)
       accuracy = multi_evaluator.setMetricName("accuracy").evaluate(val_predictions)
       f1 = multi_evaluator.setMetricName("f1").evaluate(val_predictions)
       
       # Log metrics
       mlflow.log_metrics({
           "auc": auc,
           "accuracy": accuracy,
           "f1": f1
       })
       
       # Log model
       mlflow.spark.log_model(rf_model, "model")
   ```

6. **Distributed Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   ```python
   import mlflow
   from hyperopt import fmin, tpe, hp, SparkTrials, STATUS_OK
   import numpy as np
   
   # Define the objective function
   def objective(params):
       # Extract parameters
       max_depth = int(params["max_depth"])
       num_trees = int(params["num_trees"])
       
       # Create model with these parameters
       rf = RandomForestClassifier(
           featuresCol="features",
           labelCol="churn",
           numTrees=num_trees,
           maxDepth=max_depth,
           seed=42
       )
       
       # Train model
       model = rf.fit(train_processed)
       
       # Make predictions
       predictions = model.transform(val_processed)
       
       # Evaluate
       auc = binary_evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
       
       # Define the loss (negative AUC to minimize)
       loss = -auc
       
       # Log with MLflow
       with mlflow.start_run(nested=True):
           mlflow.log_params({
               "max_depth": max_depth,
               "num_trees": num_trees
           })
           mlflow.log_metrics({
               "auc": auc,
               "loss": loss
           })
       
       return {"loss": loss, "status": STATUS_OK}
   
   # Define search space
   search_space = {
       "max_depth": hp.quniform("max_depth", 5, 15, 1),
       "num_trees": hp.quniform("num_trees", 50, 200, 50)
   }
   
   # Run hyperparameter tuning with SparkTrials
   with mlflow.start_run(run_name="rf_hyperopt"):
       # Set up SparkTrials for distributed tuning
       spark_trials = SparkTrials(parallelism=4)
       
       # Run the optimization
       best_params = fmin(
           fn=objective,
           space=search_space,
           algo=tpe.suggest,
           max_evals=20,
           trials=spark_trials
       )
       
       # Convert to proper types
       best_params["max_depth"] = int(best_params["max_depth"])
       best_params["num_trees"] = int(best_params["num_trees"])
       
       # Log best parameters

       })
       
       print("Best parameters:", best_params)
   ```

7. **Train Final Model and Evaluate:**
   ```python
   # Train final model with best parameters
   final_rf = RandomForestClassifier(
       featuresCol="features",
       labelCol="churn",
       numTrees=best_params["num_trees"],
       maxDepth=best_params["max_depth"],
       seed=42
   )
   
   # Combine train and validation for final training
   train_val = train.union(val)
   train_val_processed = preprocessing_model.transform(train_val)
   
   with mlflow.start_run(run_name="rf_final"):
       # Log parameters
       mlflow.log_params({
           "numTrees": best_params["num_trees"],

       # Train final model
       final_model = final_rf.fit(train_val_processed)
       
       # Evaluate on test set
       test_processed = preprocessing_model.transform(test)
       test_predictions = final_model.transform(test_processed)
       
       # Calculate metrics
       test_auc = binary_evaluator.evaluate(test_predictions)
       test_accuracy = multi_evaluator.setMetricName("accuracy").evaluate(test_predictions)

   full_pipeline_stages = preprocessing_stages + [final_model]
   full_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=full_pipeline_stages)
   
   # Train the full pipeline on the entire dataset

       print(f"Generated predictions for {results.count()} customers")
       
       return results
   ```

10. **Monitor Model Performance:**

#### Feature Engineering Techniques

**Scaling Methods Comparison**

| Scaler | Transformation | Use Case |
| ------ | -------------- | -------- |
| StandardScaler | (x - mean) / std | Features with Gaussian distribution |
| MinMaxScaler | (x - min) / (max - min) | When specific range is needed (0-1) |
| MaxAbsScaler | x / max(abs(x)) | Sparse data, preserves zero values |
| Normalizer | x / ||x|| | When only the direction (not magnitude) matters |

**High-Cardinality Features**
```python
# Option 1: Feature hashing
from pyspark.ml.feature import FeatureHasher
hasher = FeatureHasher(inputCols=["category"], outputCol="category_hashed", numFeatures=50)

# Option 2: Target encoding for supervised learning
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import avg, col

window_spec = Window.partitionBy("category")
df = df.withColumn("category_encoded", avg("target").over(window_spec))
```

#### MLflow Advanced Usage

**Nested Runs**
```python
# Parent run with nested children
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="parent_run") as parent_run:
    mlflow.log_param("parent_param", "value")
    
    # First child run
    with mlflow.start_run(run_name="child_run_1", nested=True) as child_run_1:
        mlflow.log_param("child_1_param", "value")
        mlflow.log_metric("child_1_metric", 0.95)
    
    # Second child run
    with mlflow.start_run(run_name="child_run_2", nested=True) as child_run_2:
        mlflow.log_param("child_2_param", "value")
        mlflow.log_metric("child_2_metric", 0.98)
```

**Model Registry Workflow**
```python
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()

# Register model from a run
model_uri = f"runs:/{run_id}/model"
registered_model = mlflow.register_model(model_uri, "model_name")

# Transition stages
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="model_name",
    version=1,
    stage="Staging"
)

# Add description
client.update_model_version(
    name="model_name",
    version=1,
    description="Model trained with hyperparameter tuning"
)

# Set tags
client.set_model_version_tag(
    name="model_name",
    version=1,
    key="dataset",
    value="Q1_2023_data"
)
```

#### Production ML Best Practices

**Drift Detection**
```python
from scipy.stats import ks_2samp

def detect_feature_drift(reference_data, current_data, feature_col, threshold=0.05):
    """Detect drift in a feature using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test."""
    
    # Convert to pandas for statistical test
    ref_values = reference_data.select(feature_col).toPandas()[feature_col]
    cur_values = current_data.select(feature_col).toPandas()[feature_col]
    
    # Run KS test
    ks_result = ks_2samp(ref_values, cur_values)
    
    # Check for significant drift
    drift_detected = ks_result.pvalue < threshold
    
    return {
        "feature": feature_col,
        "statistic": float(ks_result.statistic),
        "p_value": float(ks_result.pvalue),
        "drift_detected": drift_detected
    }
```

**Automated Retraining**
```python
def should_retrain_model(current_metrics, new_data, min_improvement=0.01):
    """Determine if model should be retrained based on validation performance."""
    
    # Split new data for evaluation
    train_data, eval_data = new_data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)
    
    # Train a new model on new data
    new_model = train_model(train_data)
    
    # Evaluate on hold-out data
    new_metrics = evaluate_model(new_model, eval_data)
    
    # Compare with current model performance
    improvement = new_metrics["auc"] - current_metrics["auc"]
    
    return {
        "should_retrain": improvement > min_improvement,
        "improvement": improvement,
        "new_metrics": new_metrics
    }
```
