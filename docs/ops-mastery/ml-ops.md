## Introduction to MLOps

> *"Only a model that is running in production can bring value."*

Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is a set of practices at the intersection of Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering designed to reliably and efficiently take machine learning models from development to production. 

Traditionally, machine learning has been approached from a perspective of individual scientific experiments carried out in isolation by data scientists. However, as machine learning models become integral to real-world solutions and critical to business operations, organizations must shift their perspective—not to depreciate scientific principles but to make them more accessible, reproducible, and collaborative.

### Why MLOps Matters

The stakes are high: according to industry research, approximately **85% of ML projects fail to make it to production**. Of those that do, many struggle with issues like model drift, poor scalability, inadequate monitoring, and high maintenance costs. MLOps aims to address these challenges by bringing engineering discipline to the entire ML lifecycle.

The rise of MLOps correlates with the increasing recognition of production models as the key to deriving value from machine learning investments. In 2020-2021, a significant shift occurred in the ML landscape:

- Over **50%** of data scientists focused on developing models for production
- Over **40%** were actively deploying models to production
- Steadily rising interest in MLOps based on search volume and industry adoption

----

### The Goal of MLOps

The primary goal of MLOps is to:

> **Reduce technical friction to get models from idea into production in the shortest possible time with the lowest possible risk.**

This statement contains two key aspects:

1. **Reducing time to market** - Accelerating the path from model development to production deployment
2. **Reducing risk** - Minimizing the potential for failure, knowledge loss, and regulatory issues

By addressing these two aspects, MLOps helps data scientists and business stakeholders speak the same language and frames MLOps as a business-driven necessity rather than just a technical improvement.

---

## The Fundamental Challenge: ML vs. Traditional Software

Understanding why MLOps is necessary requires recognizing how machine learning development fundamentally differs from traditional software development.

### The Data Dimension

Traditional software development is primarily concerned with code. A version of code produces a version of software, following well-established development practices. Machine learning, however, introduces a new variable: **data**.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Traditional Software"
        Code --> Build --> Software
    end
    
    subgraph "Machine Learning"
        MLCode[Code] & Data & Params[Parameters] & Env[Environment] --> Training --> Model
    end
    
    class Machine emphasis
```

In ML, it's not just about code—a model is the product of both code and data working together. This introduces several complexities:

#### Development Feedback Cycles
While software developers can see the effects of code changes almost instantaneously, ML practitioners must retrain models to see results—potentially taking hours or days with large datasets.

#### Infrastructure Requirements
ML often requires specialized infrastructure (like GPU clusters) that traditional software development does not.

#### Reproducibility Challenges
To reproduce ML results, you need to reproduce both the code environment and the exact data used—dramatically increasing complexity.

#### Versioning Complexity
You must version both code and data, along with model parameters, training environments, and configurations.

----

### Visualization: Traditional Software vs. ML Development

| Traditional Software Development | Machine Learning Development |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Code → Build → Software | Code + Data + Parameters + Environment → Training → Model |
| Well-established practices | Emerging standards |
| Code versioning sufficient | Must version code, data, and configurations |
| Quick feedback cycles | Lengthy training/evaluation cycles |
| Focused on functionality | Focused on performance and accuracy |

This fundamental difference leads to new challenges in areas like version control, testing, deployment, and monitoring—all of which are addressed by MLOps practices.

---

## The MLOps Lifecycle

The MLOps lifecycle represents the continuous flow of ML development, deployment, and improvement. Unlike the traditional "waterfall" handover from design to development to operations, MLOps emphasizes a continuous feedback loop.

### Understanding the ML Model Lifecycle

In theory, the ML model lifecycle should flow smoothly:

1. Design the model
2. Develop the model
3. Deploy to operations
4. Monitor and gather feedback
5. Update and improve

However, in reality, most organizations still operate with messy manual handovers between model development and operations. This results in significant time-to-market delays, as development is only **10% of the effort**, while **90% is spent on the "glue coding"** required to move models to production.

----

### The Continuous MLOps Loop

```mermaid
graph TB
    Design[Design & Data Preparation] --> Development[Model Development]
    Development --> Evaluation[Model Evaluation]
    Evaluation --> Deployment[Model Deployment]
    Deployment --> Monitoring[Monitoring & Feedback]
    Monitoring --> Iteration[Iteration & Improvement]
    Iteration --> Design
    
    class Deployment,Monitoring emphasis
```

A mature MLOps practice transforms the linear process into a continuous loop:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Design and Data Preparation** | Define the problem, gather and prepare data |
| **Model Development** | Experiment with model architectures and hyperparameters |
| **Model Evaluation** | Validate model performance against established metrics |
| **Model Deployment** | Transition the model to the production environment |
| **Monitoring and Feedback** | Continuously observe model performance and data drift |
| **Iteration and Improvement** | Use feedback to update and enhance the model |

This loop operates at two speeds: the longer outer loop of new model development, and the more frequent inner loop of model retraining and updates. Automating both loops is a key goal of MLOps.

---

## Key Stakeholders and Team Structure

Machine learning projects involve diverse roles across multiple disciplines. Understanding these roles and establishing effective collaboration between them is critical to MLOps success.

### Core Roles in MLOps

----

### Cross-Functional Collaboration

> **"The most successful MLOps implementations come from breaking down silos between teams."**

Effective MLOps requires breaking down silos between these roles. The traditional approach where data scientists work in isolation, then "throw the model over the wall" to engineering teams, leads to delays, miscommunication, and failed deployments.

Instead, MLOps promotes:

1. **Shared language and tools**: Common vocabulary and toolsets that all team members understand
2. **Clear hand-off procedures**: Well-defined processes for transitioning work between roles
3. **Collaborative practices**: Joint planning, regular cross-functional meetings, and shared responsibility
4. **T-shaped skills**: Encouraging specialists to develop broad understanding across adjacent domains

In smaller organizations, individuals may fulfill multiple roles. Regardless of organization size, having clear role definitions while maintaining cross-functional collaboration is essential.

---

## Core MLOps Components

### 5.1 Data Engineering and Management

At the foundation of any ML system is data. The quality, availability, and usability of data directly impact model performance and reliability. MLOps emphasizes structured approaches to data management throughout the ML lifecycle.

#### Data Exploration and Validation

Data exploration is the first concrete step in any ML project. The purpose is to understand the data before attempting to model it.

**Key aspects of data exploration**:
- Visual examination of data distributions and relationships
- Identification of patterns, outliers, and potential issues

    end
    
    FS --- R
    FS --- O
    FS --- ON
    FS --- A
    
    class FS emphasis
```

**Feature Stores** are specialized systems that solve several critical challenges in feature management:

1. **Feature computation and serving**: Transforming raw data into feature values and serving them for both training and inference
2. **Feature sharing and reuse**: Allowing teams to discover and reuse features across multiple models
