## Platform Business Models

### Understanding Platforms

**A platform is a business that creates value by facilitating direct interactions between two or more distinct types of customers.**

### Three Essential Elements of Platforms

1. **Two or more distinct customer types**
2. **Direct interaction between different customers**
3. **Facilitation of customer interactions**

### Types of Platform Business Models

## Domain 2: Competition - Understanding Asymmetric Competition

### Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Competition

#### Symmetric Competitors
- **Same value proposition**
- **Same business model**
- Example: Honda, Ford, GM, Tesla vs. Toyota

#### Asymmetric Competitors
- **Competing value proposition**
- **Different business models**
- Example: Uber vs. Toyota (different investments, skills, technologies, revenue models)

### The Competitive Value Train

The competitive value train helps understand the mix of competition and cooperation between business partners and identifies who has leverage in delivering value to customers.

    class A,B,C,D valueChain
    class A1,B1,C1,D1 details
    class E,F competitors
```

### Applications of Value Train Analysis

#### Disintermediation
- **Definition**: Cutting out the middleman
- **Example**: Streaming services bypassing cable distributors
- **Example**: Google allowing direct airline ticket purchases

#### Intermediation
- **Definition**: New entrants inserting themselves into existing value chains
- **Example**: Mobile wallets between credit cards and purchasers
- **Example**: Facebook in newspaper industry value chain

### Rules of Power in Value Trains

1. **Power goes to unique value creators**
2. **Power tends to go to the edges** (closest to customer or originator)

### Managing Competition Challenges

#### Channel Conflict
- Exploring new strategies that conflict with existing distribution channels
- Requires careful balance between innovation and current partnerships

#### Zero-Sum Mentality
- Moving beyond win-lose thinking
- Recognizing that multiple players can thrive simultaneously
- Understanding complex modern competitive dynamics

### The Divergent Experimental Method (MVP Approach)

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: A bare-bones creation with just enough features to allow useful feedback from early adopters.

**MVP Formula: Minimal Cost + Maximum Learning**

### Six Principles of Experimentation

1. **Fall in love with the problem**, not the solution
2. **Learn early** to reduce risk and cost
3. **Test your assumptions** systematically
4. **Focus on speed of learning** over perfection
5. **Measure what matters now** for current decisions
6. **Fail smart** to maximize learning from failures

### The Four Parts of Failing Smart

## Domain 5: Value - Adapting Your Value Proposition

### From Sustaining to Adapting

**Value represents a shift from sustaining your current value proposition to adapting to changing market needs.** In the digital age, maintaining an unchanging value proposition invites disruption.

### Recognizing Value from Customer's Perspective

Understanding how customer needs evolve is crucial for value proposition adaptation:

## Mastering Disruptive Business Models

### Understanding True Disruption

**Disruption occurs when an existing industry faces a challenger that offers far greater value to customers in a way that existing firms cannot compete with directly.**

Not every innovation is disruptive. True disruption requires specific characteristics that distinguish it from regular competition or innovation.

### The Disruptive Business Model Map

```

### Components of Business Models

#### Value Proposition
- **What you offer** to customers
- **How you create value** for different customer segments
- **Why customers choose you** over alternatives

#### Value Network
- **People and partners** required for value creation
- **Assets and capabilities** needed for delivery
- **Revenue model** and cost structure
- **Processes and systems** enabling value capture

### The Two-Part Test for Disruption

For a business model to be truly disruptive, it must pass both tests:

#### Test 1: Radically Displace Value
- Dramatically superior value proposition
- 10x improvement in key customer metrics
- Makes incumbent offerings seem inadequate
- Addresses previously underserved market segments

#### Test 2: Barrier to Imitation
- **Business model conflict**: Incumbent can't respond without cannibalizing existing business
- **Technical barriers**: Requires fundamental technology rebuild
- **Cultural barriers**: Contradicts incumbent's organizational DNA
- **Economic barriers**: Incompatible with existing revenue/cost structure

### Variables of Disruptive Business Models

1. **Customer Trajectory**: How customer needs evolve over time
2. **Scope of Disruption**: Industry-wide vs. segment-specific impact
3. **Multiple Incumbents**: Various established players affected differently

### Six Incumbent Response Strategies
