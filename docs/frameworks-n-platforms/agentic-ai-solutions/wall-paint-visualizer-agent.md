## 2. Problem Statement

Customers selecting paint colors for their homes face significant challenges in the traditional selection process:

- Difficulty imagining how specific colors will appear in their unique spaces with varying lighting conditions
- Inability to visualize how color choices coordinate with existing furniture and architectural elements
- Limited perspective from small paint swatches that inadequately represent wall-scale color impact
- Wasted investment in multiple sample cans for colors that ultimately don't meet expectations
- Significant time delays between color consideration and final decision, extending project timelines
- Decision fatigue leading to uncertainty and dissatisfaction with final choices

These challenges result in decision paralysis, delayed purchases, increased returns, and diminished customer satisfaction with the overall paint selection experience.

## 3. Solution Approach

The Wall Paint Visualizer Agent addresses these challenges by:

- Enabling customers to upload photos of their actual rooms
- Leveraging advanced generative AI to apply paint colors to walls while preserving all other room elements
- Maintaining architectural integrity and spatial relationships in modified room images
- Ensuring color accuracy that precisely matches physical product offerings
- Providing side-by-side comparison capabilities for evaluating multiple color options
- Delivering results within seconds to maintain customer engagement

This solution transforms the color selection process from a speculative exercise into a confidence-building visualization experience that accelerates purchase decisions and improves customer satisfaction.

## 4. Architecture

The solution architecture encompasses multiple layers working together to deliver comprehensive room visualization capabilities.
