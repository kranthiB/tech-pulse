# AI Code Assistant Performance Scoring Framework

## Overview

This scorecard provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI code assistants, measuring performance across four key domains: Intelligence, Acceleration, Experience, and Value. Each domain contains specific criteria rated on a scale of 0-10 points, creating a total potential score of 100 points.

## Conclusion

This performance scorecard provides a structured approach to evaluating AI code assistants across multiple dimensions. By systematically assessing each tool against these criteria, organizations can select the solution that best aligns with their specific development needs and priorities.

The highest-performing AI code assistants will demonstrate strengths across all four domainsâ€”Intelligence, Acceleration, Experience, and Valueâ€”though the relative importance of each domain may vary depending on your organization's specific requirements and constraints.
